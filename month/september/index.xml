      <title>Exploring Chiang Mai, Thailand</title>

      <description>For most people, Thailand is Bangkok and vis-a-vis. That included us too, until we had the opportunity to travel to Chiang Mai which happens to be an equally (if not more) important city in Thailand and has much to offer. We hardly had enough time to explore enough but these photographs are from one of the days we felt adventurous enough to venture into the busy city streets.</description>

      <title>Keylong : A Few Days before Cut-Off</title>

      <description>We were on our way down from Shasur Gompa. The Gompa visit was a self-guided tour and hence it was limited to looking around at flags, murals and ubiquitous style and architecture that we had seen before and making up our own stories and assumptions. But I was sure we missed a lot. There must have been a larger history and then a local history. There must have been some drama and a legend and a myth.</description>

      <title>Getting Stuck at Tumbes</title>

      <description>If getting to Tumbes wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy, getting out wasn&amp;rsquo;t any easier either. As I sat staring at the news-reporter on the TV and reading the news-ticker which was in English reporting on the riots in Ecuador, I felt completely helpless and hopeless. All the local TV channels were reporting on the same topic and no amount of switching channels was going to change anything for us. We were simply destined to be stuck in that mostly unknown border town till something changed radically in the next few days or we retreated in defeat.</description>

      <title>The Amazon and its Tributaries</title>

      <description>It was exactly how I had imagined it; perhaps better than that, because I remember sitting on that boat spellbound and self-aware that I had gone very quiet. The boat was navigating through the Maranon river in whose waters reflected the rising sun. The reflection moved ahead as we did ever so slowly, unhurried by the seeming speed that was implied by the engine itself which was the only thing I can remember as noise.</description>

      <title>Homes on Stilts in the Amazon</title>

      <description>The bare-bones dwelling on stilts appeared like creatures that could discreetly shy away inland when the river asserts its rights annually. I was excited like never before to step inside, as Jana (pronounced Yaana) explained the basics to us. Jana was a volunteer with the organization. She spoke with passion about the project; its mission and accomplishments. But mainly, she paused to speak about the mosquitoes when I inquired. I did not have an original inquiry.</description>

      <title>Indigo Dyeing : Phrae, Thailand</title>

      <description>The various shades of blue on either side of the main road told us that we had reached our destination - Ban Thung Hong, the Blue Village as it is popularly known. A group of six friends with a shared passion for indigo, we had set out to explore the source of this beautiful colour. True to its name, this quaint village, just outside the city of Phrae is a relic from the Kingdom of Old Siam.</description>

      <title>Howler Monkeys and the Ultimate Insult</title>

      <description>We had walked for almost four hours now. With the dense canopy, it was hard to gauge the exact time of the day. I was starting to become a bit weary trying to keep one foot in front of the other, very gently and as noiselessly as possible. The mosquitoes took advantage of my tiredness and launched a fresh assault. My ears had to stay alert to grasp any sign of monkeys or birds around.</description>

      <title>The Incan Holy Grail</title>

      <description>The early morning mist enhanced the view. I was surrounded by huge lush green mountains as our bus ascended, revealing various nooks and corners. The massive green mounds appeared to float in the mist, green rocks in a vast sea of white. The air was chilly outside our bus, getting colder with every bend of the ascent. I felt the excitement of having entered something sacred, something unspoilt and hidden. To reach this sacred site by walk might have been something more spiritual.</description>

      <title>Parque Arvi : Nature overlooking Medellin</title>

      <description>Lucky are the people of Medellin that just an hour away from the busy city is one of the most beautiful parks that has not just breathtaking scenery but also some amazing biodiversity. When we ended up a whole day late in Medellin, at night, after our harrowing flight without our bags, little did I know that the misfortunes we faced the previous day would be compensated manifold by allowing us an extra day in the city that was not earlier planned.</description>

      <title>Day trip to Playa Blanca, Colombia</title>

      <description>The thought of white sandy beaches with blue waters felt almost too good to be true. Tourists mostly head to Cartagena to experience exactly this. The Caribbean islands are famous for some of the most pristine and picturesque beaches in the world. We were surprisingly one of the few who were in Cartagena without a clear intention of soaking in the sun on one of these beaches. Reluctantly, one morning, we walked to one of the hostels which was arranging day tours to Playa Blanca, which, in Spanish, simply means the White Beach.</description>

      <title>By the Caribbean coast of Cartagena</title>

      <description>If you would find yourself stuck in a time loop, where you find yourself waking up in the same place each day for the rest of your life, where would you like it to be? When I ask myself this question, one of the places that came to my mind was Cartagena. This coastal city of Northern Colombia is one of those places that offers many experiences at the same time.</description>

      <title>Tallest Palm in the World</title>
      <link>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/tallest-palm-in-the-world.html</link>

      <description>I looked up a slender tree right in front of me, I lifted my head up and up, bent backwards as far as I could balance, but failed to see the crown. The morning sun was filtering through the scant crown of the giant palms blinding me as I squinted to gauge the full extent of its height. What seemed like a regular palm tree from a distance, unimpressive at a first glance, grew to unbelievable height as I approached it.</description>

      <title>No one can stop looking at Jardin</title>
      <link>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/no-one-can-stop-looking-at-jardin.html</link>

      <description>I have many a times sifted through my memories to focus on the colourful postcards in my mind&amp;rsquo;s eye that for me represent Jardin, and I have wondered, what was it that I did there for a couple of days? As simple as it might sound, nothing really. Absolutely nothing if I were to be accurate. Yes. If there is a really good venue for doing nothing, then it had to be Jardin.</description>
