      <description>Technically, Castlerock is only half a day away from some of the largest cities and innumerable towns of North Karnataka. For that matter, this little village (to use the official term for the place), is only a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw away from the touristy destinations such as Goa. But technicalities do not matter, because despite its long history, Castlerock seems to insist on folding itself away into a corner of the Western Ghats, mostly untouched by whatever is happening a few 100 kilometres around.</description>

Back then, it was sort of an insatiable hunger, perhaps greed even to &amp;ldquo;see it all&amp;rdquo;. It was a ride on a ramshackle rented bike from Vagator - where we were shacked up; an evening ride got us there just in time for a spectacular sunset at the Arambol beach.</description>
