      <description>Local train journey in Sri Lanka is a must &amp;ldquo;to-do&amp;rdquo; to see the culture up close. And, what&amp;rsquo;s better than the coastal rail route that offers some breathtaking views of the coastline as well. Ours started at this quaint little station called Bentota.</description>

      <description>I had imagined this tear-drop-shaped island country always to have been green; a green dot floating in the endless blue waters of the mighty Indian Ocean. I would like to believe that it was once covered with dense impenetrable tropical rainforests, with innumerable waterfalls and countless streams. It was perhaps my effort to recreate this lost experience, when I chose trekking through the Sinharaja Forest Reserve as one of my first experiences in Sri Lanka.</description>

      <description>This was nothing close to what I had imagined. The boat was rather small. The waves were menacingly rough, and threatened to throw the boat off balance at the slightest opportunity. There were about 20 people on the boat, most of them in various stages of sea sickness. The lucky ones, like myself, who were miraculously unaffected by the rough sea, were on the deck with our eyes glued to the waters.</description>
