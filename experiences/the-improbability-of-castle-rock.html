					<p>Technically, Castlerock is only half a day away from some of the largest cities and innumerable
towns of North Karnataka. For that matter, this little village (to use the official term for
the place), is only a stone&rsquo;s throw away from the touristy destinations such as Goa. But
technicalities do not matter, because despite its long history, Castlerock seems to insist
on folding itself away into a corner of the Western Ghats, mostly untouched by whatever is
happening a few 100 kilometres around. My first impressions of this place was a feeling of
being transported right into the midst of a wild western film. The dusty lanes combined with
the open sky above; a railway line with a lone, long platform and a rather old looking building
that was the railway station; peppered with tops of hillocks in the background.</p>
<p>Castlerock was the International Border for many years between the British-ruled India and
the Portugal-ruled Goa. And even today, the dusty by-lanes, the railway station with a horizon
filled with nothingness, and a railway line seemingly descending into the western uncertainty;
all that did remind me of other no-man&rsquo;s-land kind of landscapes I have witnessed between the
borders of countries. But things are not always as they seem. There are frequent trains now
which pass through the plains of Karnataka and Maharashtra which use Castlerock as the gateway
to the state of Goa. Castlerock is also where the train journey takes up the challenge of
traversing the Western ghats which forms the natural border between these states.</p>
<p>We had chosen to stay at the Castlerock Nature Camp, managed by the Karnataka Forest Department
as a part of the Kali Tiger Reserve initiative. The camp was at the peripheries of the the
village and was barely accessible via a dusty road that seemed to lead us out of the village
in parallel with the west-bound railway line only to curve out abruptly to end in a parking lot
from where the journey was by foot.</p>
<p>As I waited for lunch to be served on our day of arrival I looked around the camp. The location
chosen for the camp couldn’t be more suitable. The tent we had been assigned was built on metal platforms
grouted on the northern slopes of the area that constituted the camp. The entire camp was the
top of a hill, the top of which was a bungalow which now served as a dining room for visitors
like us and from what I could understand was also lodging for the officials. There were a few more
rooms and dormitories apart from our tents scattered about, with all of this accessible from
a single lane that stretched from Castlerock village to the camp.</p>
<p>Soon, watching trains that pass through this area became our past-time. The sequence of events, both visual
and aural, that leads up to the point where an engine of a train appears to turn towards us
as it climbed up into Castlerock, was a thrill. But I wasn&rsquo;t here to watch trains at all. So
I&rsquo;d pry myself out of this trance and instead proceed to the watchtower which was built adjacent
to the bungalow. The watchtower is the highest point of the camp and perhaps one of the
highest points in Castlerock village itself unless there are multi-storey buildings that
I missed during my explorations of this place.</p>
<p>I had a 360 degree view of the surroundings from the watchtower. Most of the north west,
north and west were higher terrain but nevertheless kilometres away, leaving a large valley
right in front of us that was just the densest green I have seen. It was clear that
there existed no roads, or pathways into those areas other than for the ones who were able to
clear their own. In fact, I could fathom the existence of a trail only when one of the
staff members started walking into the thicket and vanished into the green when the plumbing
work that delivered water to the camp from a nearby stream needed some repair. From the watchtower,
looking towards the east and south-east was a treat. I stared and squinted but could not find
a definitive line that marked the end of the western ghats as it reduced in altitude into a
greyish blue nothingness. As is the common way to put it, an undulating green carpet of
wilderness. The south and east were higher ground and was mostly the camp itself and
Castlerock, but it was also the hill beyond which the trains heading to the coast disappeared.</p>
<p>The open sky revealed raptors once in a while; mostly eagles whose exact species I
couldn&rsquo;t identify. They circled high above the valleys and every once in a while descended
into it and vanished from my eyesight. What stayed within visuals were the small birds
though, and there were plenty of them. Some of the shrubs in and around the camp itself
seemed to be attracting a huge amount and varied species of birds. Sunbirds of all
colours, Parrots, Munias and the like were constantly looking for food, stepping away
for a bit as I approached them and returning for their goodies when I gave them a safe
distance.</p>

<p>My hope to see any mammals that might walk into the camp never materialized. Perhaps
it was the terrain or it was the location of the camp, which did not make any sense
for an animal to treat it as thoroughfare. Or perhaps it was the fact that there was a
railway line that constantly disturbed the creatures and they had learned to avoid the
area in general. Whatever it was, I never encountered a single mammal while I was
there. Birdwatching was however a different game. From rare pigeons to swallows, from
woodpeckers to hornbills, the birds, unlike the mammals had the cliff and beyond
to explore, unperturbed by any development at the village. Hence they seemed to be
thriving and was were thus a continued source of inspiration for me.</p>
<p>The major development seemed to be at the railway station itself. A stroll outside the
camp and a decision to walk along the railway line took me close to the station
premises. Truckloads of building material was being moved to-and-fro and there seemed
to be activity everywhere; concrete being mixed, iron-rods being cut to size and
mortar being moved in a relay by labourers. Although I could never entirely decipher
what was going on, it was apparent that there would be a lot of tree-cutting, building
of new-structures and laying of railway lines. Whatever it was, I&rsquo;d have to be prepared
to see a different Castlerock if I returned in the future.</p>
<p>If daylight was spent at the camp lazing around and birdwatching, then the night was
spent listening to the forest. The tent I lived in offered a sit-out that directly
faced the valley. The dull bluish moonlight suggested some contours, size and
distance to the dense forests with its creatures that went about their nightly ventures.
Both before and after dinner, I spent hours staring into the darkness and trying to look for
activity. After a while I got used to the darkness, and either actually did or
completely deluded myself into thinking that I had motion sensors enabled in myself
to detect life. A branch shook here or a twig broke there. It was a forest after all.
I could imagine what was happening. I&rsquo;d have to admit that I saw nothing. But the
mere experience of being there, in a remote part of Karnataka, was experience
enough.</p>
