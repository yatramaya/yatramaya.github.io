					<p>When someone I met recently was reciting the checklist of places he visited in the US and he mentioned New York, Vegas and Grand Canyon in one sentence, it disturbed me. He had achieved the feat of covering Grand Canyon within a day, from a helicopter, looking below. &ldquo;Oh here&rsquo;s the Grand Canyon. I&rsquo;m done seeing it. Checked. Let&rsquo;s move on&rdquo;. I started thinking if that was possible at all for any place, let alone something as mammoth as the Grand Canyon, which has &ldquo;grand&rdquo; in its name itself. Doesn&rsquo;t it deserve better? My thoughts went back to my own multi day exploration of the canyon which left me thirsty for more, if anything.</p>
<p>When I wanted to experience the Grand canyon in all its glory and I realized I have only four days to do this, I already felt like giving up. The expanse is unimaginable, its boundaries touching four states with its two rims the North and the South hundreds of miles apart (by road). I had to make a difficult choice - North or South. It couldn&rsquo;t be both. I wish I had more time to hike from the North Rim down to the valley and continue to reach the South Rim; that would have been something I would have considered closer to covering the Canyon at least by one dimension - the height. It would still not do justice to the expanse of it, the span of its length. Due to limitations in campsite bookings and our style of travel where we do not plan the exact dates and stick to it, we had to satisfy ourselves with the North Rim. It saddens me now, sitting thousands of miles away, two flights away, that I would never be able to see the South or West Rims.</p>
<p>We stayed at a campsite just outside the Grand Canyon National Park, at about half an hour of driving from the North Rim. That driving, in the dark, was nothing short of magical. We kept our eyes glued to the road so as to increase chances of spotting night creatures. We took frequent breaks by the side of the road to simply stare into the darkness. At one point we stopped at a completely dark spot for a few minutes. Time stood still. I was transformed to another world. All around me was this vast nothingness. I could see the shimmering dome above with millions of celestial objects. The milky way spread across the sky creating an arc. For those few moments, with no  human activity around, in the middle of this vast desert, where the sky met the earth, my thoughts came to a stand still. Though I was in the middle of vast wilderness, there was no fear, no anxiety to reach civilization. I was content to be right there, forever.</p>

<p>There were many known trails in the area and over the few days we had, we intended to cover some of them, at least one. But before we set out to do that, there was the canyon itself, which could be seen, perceived and felt from many different angles. Slowly we got to know the canyon from many different viewpoints. The view points were strategically constructed to give us the most breathtaking views of the canyon. Each point that I walked to gave me the feeling of insignificance; made me realize the triviality of my existence. Nothing man-made I had seen so far could come anywhere close in comparison to this absolute raw beauty. My hopeless attempts to show its size in photographs failed miserably. I would have liked to glide like a bird in the middle of the canyon along its length, and that is probably what the one who took a helicopter ride wanted too; I can totally understand. I however like to experience the terrain, the heat, the vegetation, the feel of gravel under my shoe. And I believe that nothing so beautiful and rare should come easily to us.</p>
<p>So when we were done looking at the Grand Canyon, we set off on our quest to feel it. Following the trail map provided at the visitor&rsquo;s centre, we crossed our first significant point, the Coconino overlook, which was a large flatter area from where there were panoramic views. I sat there soaking up the entire valley below and watching some raptors that were flying nearby. The canyon had a magnetic pull; the more I hiked down into the canyon the more it drew me in. It was so deep that after hours of walking, I felt like I had gotten nowhere substantial. The river was flowing somewhere down there in the gorge. I had an urge to continue the hike till I was able to stand at the riverbed and then look up to see these towering fortresses all around. I found it hard to stop myself although my knees were crying out due to the mostly steep downward descent. For once, I was hoping for some climbing up. If the heat did not slow us down, it was the breathtaking view that made me stop every now and then and look around and experience the vastness. The Supine tunnel, a short tunnel carved out into the red sandstone was an interesting feature along this trail. I was looking forward to a break and a refill of the water bottles.</p>
<p>From this point, the trail was more exposed to direct sunlight and there was no respite in the form of bushes or any shade whatsoever. We followed the trail further down till it descended steeply to reach an overhanging bridge, the Redwall Bridge. Here we met some hikers who had just crossed us to continue their descent further into the valley. However tempting it was, crossing this bridge would commit us to an overnight halt at the Phantom Ranch, which we were not lucky enough to get a reservation at. This beautiful ranch is generally fully booked on almost all days with people reserving it almost a year in advance. This was the deepest we could go on this hike, named the North Kaibab Trail. As I turned back to retrace my steps, I could see the enormous distance we had already covered as the trail seemed to vanish into the sky. We had the daunting task of climbing this steep terrain now. As we were climbing, past three in the afternoon, we were surprised to meet a runner who wanted to better his own record of running down the canyon and back in a couple of hours and reach comfortably before sunset. This grandiose natural wonder can mean many things to many; a raw piece of natural beauty, a lesson in history and archaeology, an endurance test and much more. To me it was one of the most fascinating natural structures to have existed, carved and sculpted by the sheer force of water that once flowed through it in all its glory.</p>
