					<p>They say, there is always a first time for everything. I remember some of my
firsts and not all of them are pleasant ones. As the bus pulled up into a
nondescript corner of the street and the conductor announced that we had arrived,
I felt another first; anxious thoughts about the next few minutes. The last few
hours were spent in the knowledge of what we were up to but anxiety had not taken
over due to the novelty of what was on offer. The bus had brought us through
the western Kenyan landscape that even if not entirely unique still had something
to offer. We had passed through villages and towns that were far smaller and
closer to African realities than say the Nairobis and Mombasas. Seeing rural
Kenya was one of the goals of our trip but I also had the opportunity to
experience the ground-zero-level heat when the bus route cut across the equator
itself. All that ended when we reached Malaba.</p>
<p>Malaba is a border town that existed by the same name on either side of the
border. The Ugandan side is where we wished to be if everything went well. It
was the first time we would be crossing over a country&rsquo;s land border by foot. I
knew that in a way there was nothing special about it. It only so happens that
I was born into a world at a time when Air travel was considered normal. Obviously
there were times before that when land and sea and their natural borders had to
be crossed. But I also knew that air travel invented logical borders. Long
before one immigrated, one was already physically in foreign soil. There was
something physical and palpable of looking at a fence or a gate and knowing
that people, culture, money, food, religion, smiles, thoughts, love, sports and
life could all be different just across a line that cut me across perpendicularly
and I could be on the other side, if only I had the right papers. If the
countries were divided by large chasms of economy or politics, this simple act
of stepping across space can sometimes be akin to moving through a portal and
a time-machine. In this particular case though, it wasn&rsquo;t very different. Kenya
and Uganda are different but not that different.</p>
<p>We walked from where the bus stopped towards the only building that stood out.
A large structure that was manned by people with guns who are not supposed to
betray emotions, if any. The large men glanced at us as we walked along with
many others; it wasn&rsquo;t for long though, perhaps they had done it for so long that
it only took a second to arrive at a decision if we needed to be stopped for
any interrogations. The horizon looked like a retreating sandstorm although we
weren&rsquo;t anywhere near a desert. On the contrary we were getting closer
and closer to the Nile Basin. It was mostly the fact that all this was out of
the normal jurisdiction and hence non-asphalted roads on either side and all
the people who were stomping through from either side; anxious and hurried. What
I noticed most was how the physical act of actually seeing that border in the
horizon is special when compared to &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; it or seeing a few coloured lines
on a map. There was no fence or gate, just what looked like a bridge across a
narrow river which, like the town it is located in, is named named Malaba.</p>
<p>But before I could step into the horizon, we had to comply. We were guided by
common sense combined with armed personnel towards the waiting area of the
large building where the atmosphere was physically and mentally cooler. People
were not jostling or rushing here and there were various queues for various
demands and demographies. I dropped the backpack in a corner and proceeded to
an officer who found my papers satisfactory and asked a few questions mostly
on my intended purpose of visit and time of stay. Having enveloped all that I
wanted to do into the single term &ldquo;tourism&rdquo; and blurted out a random but
reasonable number of days, he stamped me in. I was excited. Mythical horizon
would soon be reality! We were asked to follow the line that was exiting out of the
building onto the western side.</p>
<p>As we approached the river that formed the natural boundary of these two countries
at this place, I walked slowly, like enjoying the last remaining parts of an
ice-cream. This was new, and every moment of it was new and had to be etched
into my bones if it was possible. Some of the locals from either side were
looking at us and passing us like we were a hindrance to the process. Quite
obviously there was nothing to gawk about if livelihood or circumstance were to
make one cross these borders on a daily basis. I used the large backpack as an
excuse for a slow pace of walk. It was easier to shift the blame onto practicalities
like that rather than the romantic and naive imaginations of a tourist; one
could turn it all into sympathy then. The crossing was over in about 30 seconds.
That was all the bridge lasted. I distinctly remember thinking how nothing would
be different and yet everything would be. I perhaps even took in a breath in
Kenya and exhaled it in Uganda, picked up some dust on my shoe in one country
and deposited it in the other. But even a walk in a park would be like that.
The euphoria ended as soon as it began though. There were practicalities again.</p>
<p>Incidentally on the Ugandan side the immigration building was located after
making due choices at a fork in the road.
I dared not think what happens to people who did not do some thinking and walked
over into the town which was visible just a few feet away straight ahead where
buildings were popping up and vehicles moved. We knew we had to take the fork
left that led us to a gate. There were no army personnel or security guards who
forced us to go there but we did. It was yet another large building, this one
looking more colonial than the previous one with a facade of large pillars and
a flower garden. Compared to the town itself that I noticed up ahead earlier,
the structure seemed completely out of place. But it was real, it existed and
we were supposed to enter it. I went through the motions yet again; the officer
did too and this one did not even have any questions. The mere fact that I was
good enough to be let out of Kenya was good enough reason for me to be let into Uganda.
Or perhaps everything was just in order and it was my lucky day. The process
was completed in about five minutes. This time there wasn&rsquo;t a western-gate. I
felt like we had by our own accord entered a building to watch a play or buy
something. We got out of the building and pretty much retraced our way back to
the junction we passed through earlier and walked into the real Uganda, that
was free of diplomatic paraphernalia. I think I was anxious again, or perhaps
excited.</p>
