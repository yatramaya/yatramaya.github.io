					<p>If getting to Tumbes wasn&rsquo;t easy, getting out wasn&rsquo;t any easier either. As I sat staring
at the news-reporter on the TV and reading the news-ticker which was in English
reporting on the riots in Ecuador, I felt completely helpless and hopeless. All
the local TV channels were reporting on the same topic and no amount of switching
channels was going to change anything for us. We were simply destined to be stuck
in that mostly unknown border town till something changed radically in the next few
days or we retreated in defeat. I wondered if it could have been better. The
warning signs were posted early and in hindsight, I think we could have abandoned
this plan much earlier.</p>
<p>It was about a week before we actually made it to Tumbes. We were at Chiclayo
which was supposed to be a minor stop after we had completed a large chunk of
our adventures in Peru and the next item in our itinerary was to visit the
Galapagos islands which officially belonged to the country of Ecuador. If things
went as per plan, we would experience a cherish-able cruise around the islands
and then we would fly out of Guayaquil to New York, a ticket that we had obtained
for a decent price and was also our proof of exiting the continent itself which
was a necessity in the visa affairs through this entire backpacking trip. I
distinctly remember taking it lightly as news of riots appeared on TV the first
time, when we went and booked an international bus service that should take
us from Chiclayo to Guayaquil via Tumbes border crossing. The riots began as
protests in Quito against the revoking of fuel subsidies but soon became a
pan-country event. We felt the first jolt when we checked out of the hotel after
saying our goodbyes to the friendly staff and arrived at the bus station only
to be told &ldquo;Lo Siento&rdquo; (sorry) and - our money returned - citing that the bus that
we were supposed to board had been cancelled. The walk from the bus station to
the hotel again, the explanations, the patronizing looks and sympathy from the
hotel staff; all that was painful. The journey through Peru and even the rest of
the continent till that point was more or less as per plan up until. That
incident should have warned us and put some sense into us right then, but
it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>As the days passed, confidence returned; one could say overconfidence because
it only got us until the border. Just a few days after the first attempt and
despite the fact that there was nothing positive being reported in the news
from Ecuador, we attempted booking tickets with another bus company that claimed
that the borders had indeed opened and they would ply the route. Galapagos
beckoned! I was excited again as we boarded a bus that was full of anxious faces,
many others who perhaps like us had postponed their journeys. Nevertheless, most
of that trip was in good spirits. i.e. until at midnight when the stewardess
walked the aisle and woke up people and informed in Spanish that the bus would
go no further. I had just been woken up and added to that was still not confident
with the language, especially in crisis, so at first I assumed that we had just
stopped for border crossing. But my impatience slowly turned into dread and horror when
we were informed that the bus was going to be indefinitely parked because it could
go no further than Tumbes. The bus was parked in the yard belong to the office
of the travel company and we were all asked to sit in the waiting lounge. The
time was around 1am and Tumbes was just a sleeping town outside that we should
have only been passing through.</p>
<p>When the darkness outside gave way to light, dust, jostling, people and eventually
traffic, we however, were still there. We continued to be there when we accepted part
of our payment and when they called us all for a meeting and announced that &ldquo;this
is it, there is nothing we can do&rdquo;. We refused their offer to take us in the same
bus back to Chiclayo (for no additional payment). We accepted a refund and walked
with our backpacks looking for a place to stay. I started feeling cheated and denied.
But there wasn&rsquo;t anything I could do really other than hope for the best and find a
place to wait.</p>
<p>Tumbes, which I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have even remembered after a few months into
my return home thus became an important part of my travel memories. We had chosen
a lodging that was close to a Mall which was at the peripheries of a Plaza that
was the centre piece of the town. We chose the Mall only because unlike our
experiences at other towns and cities in Peru we found that at Tumbes our weak
point became a severe disadvantage; language. English was spoken lesser and lesser and our
broken Spanish was not passing off well. Inside the Mall were a few shops that
seemed to have folks who could talk to desperate tourists like us washed up
in nondescript towns. At the bare minimum, eating wouldn&rsquo;t be a hindrance. The
Mall had a few food joints that sold familiar items. I wasn&rsquo;t in the best of
moods and had become lesser than open to experience food or conversations so
rote familiarity such as the acceptance of universal realities such as pizzas
and burgers would be appreciated in this circumstance.</p>
<p>Since Tumbes was not particularly known for any ancient monuments or ruins, or
was not part of the tourist circuit of Peru, we found the locals here went about their
lives without taking any special note of a handful of foreigners who were passing
through. We could experience a normal, regular, uneventful time living like
locals - we even considered watching a film (the Spanish dubbed version of Joker).
We could walk the streets without being pursued by hawkers, we could walk into a
restaurant and eat ice creams and pastries along with the locals, have a drink or a
coffee watching TV and not be &ldquo;sold&rdquo; anything. Most tourists even if they cross over
from Peru to Ecuador avoid the land crossing at Tumbes as it is notorious for some petty
and serious crimes; getting mugged was all too common in a zone unoriginally known as
the no-mans-land between Peru and Ecuador.</p>
<p>In the evenings and when we weren&rsquo;t watching the news on TV we went on strolls
around the plaza and also along streets radiating away from it. Tumbes revealed itself to us
very slowly. We started our explorations for food and found a small hole in the wall
cake shops that we liked and panaderias that sold fresh bread every day. We also
found cheaper and better accommodations, one of which we would eventually shift
into. We found friendly people and bistros that served freshly cooked meals and
a good drink. When feeling a bit more adventurous we also ended up at places
that was visited only by the locals for eating dishes only they could decipher.
I remember a lunch place where we mistakenly assumed to have conveyed
everything that we needed to convey to a very friendly waiter who then placed
a plateful of items in front of us, most of it containing meat. Out of sheer
embarrassment mixed with courtesy I picked morsels of it, parts of it that were
not meat and discreetly allowed the rest to go waste.</p>
<p>Eventually, switching TV channels or lodges did not help the cause. The riots
in Ecuador stretched beyond everyone&rsquo;s expected timelines. The news-reporters
looked bored themselves providing the same update day in and day out. I started
wondering if I would even have the confidence to enter Ecuador if they actually
let us in. I dreaded the possibility of getting stuck in the middle of riots
at Guayaquil or Quito instead without being able to get out to
New York. It would have been of no use if we even made it to the mainland and not
to the Galapagos, as desired. We roamed the streets of Tumbes, hoping against
hope, to hear some positive news. Instead, our decision was sealed when out of
the blue, standing in the queue of a supermarket, a friendly man just behind us,
advised us not to go into Ecuador. He said, in Spanish, that it was better to be on
safer territory than get into a riot ridden country. We took his word as a sign
from some greater power and booked the next bus that would take us back to Chiclayo.</p>
