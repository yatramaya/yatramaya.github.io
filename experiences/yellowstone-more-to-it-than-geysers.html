					<p>The friendly immigration officer was excited when I told him that I plan to visit Yellowstone National Park. He was from the same State, Wyoming. He said that if there was one place that one cannot really miss in the United States, it has got to be Yellowstone. I thanked him for his visa-stamping, generosity and his friendly advice. The drive from Salt Lake City to Jackson hole was through some of the most beautiful landscapes - vast areas of nothingness, beautiful rock formations and canyons in unbelievable shapes; everything in various shades of brown. We were prepared to trade our safe-ground happily in exchange for three days on top the largest active cauldron of boiling, steaming broth on earth.</p>
<p>Back in 1960, when the US Geological Survey was looking for the volcano of Yellowstone, they failed to find the cone of the volcano, or what is known as Caldera. Since it was already known that an active volcano in the park accounted for all the geysers, the steamy pools, the mud-pot boilers, it was indeed puzzling to not find the source of it. Later, thanks to some high-altitude pictures of the landscape of the park, courtesy NASA, the park officials, to their surprise, realized something unthinkable - the entire stretch of the park, about two million acres in whole, constituted the caldera! This meant that when the volcano had exploded, it must have been of unimaginable scale creating a crater over forty miles wide. To realize that we were camping on top of this mega volcano gave me goosebumps. What had seemed like any other National Park with some unexplained phenomenon, after reading this piece of trivia, elevated my experience to a different scale.</p>
<p>The park, although huge, is very well organized, provided that we approach it in our own private vehicle. Trying to hitch-hike or expect any public transport (similar to what we had experienced in Denali National Park) would have been disastrous. A helpful map of the entire park, with information on the campsites, the &ldquo;attractions&rdquo;, with specific timings of the predictable geysers was itself enjoyable to read. Like all other tourists, we traced a route that would cover most, if not all, of the natural wonders we might experience there. There is no dearth of unearthly phenomenon. Sixty feet geysers that suddenly decide to spout, boiling mud baths, rainbow coloured pools of sulphur emanating a foul smell, ground that melds beneath your feet, solid ground vaporizing into steam, large limestone formations that look like frozen waterfalls, innocuous looking pools that tempt you into stepping into them only to turn you into a skeleton in an instance and multi-coloured bacteria that cosily live in these deathly pools. In short, all that should have been happening discreetly underground dragged to the surface and displayed for everyone to see. There is no parallel to these wonders anywhere on earth. They stand by themselves, unique, one-of-a-kind, and most importantly, all of them in one vast single area.</p>
<p>But the beauty of the park was not limited to subterranean phenomena. The unending plains with the herds of bison roaming free, the vast expanse of valleys with a sizeable population of wolves and coyotes, the beautiful mountains surrounding the area with refreshing waterfalls and the other small and large wildlife of the area makes up the experience of Yellowstone. Having visited in the Fall, we could see the beautiful golden, reddish colours of the foliage in the warming sun. We could only imagine how this place would be transformed in the winter, entirely blanketed in thick white snow with frozen waterfalls, steaming geysers and woolly herds of bison braving the winds and foraging. If only we take a break from the tourist attractions and sit quietly by a pond watching the sunset, we can experience the unbroken silence and beauty of the place, forgetting that a geyser might be erupting just five minutes away.</p>
<p>We stopped briefly at the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone to witness some of the most beautiful formations of rock and also for a fabulous view of the waterfalls - upper and lower. We passed hugging the beautiful and vast Yellowstone lake and drove enjoying the breathtaking views of the Hayden Valley. It was evening by the time we reached the remote camp-ground of Pebble Creek and found that it was full. This made us drive further towards the North East entrance of the Park and rent a cabin for the night. We still wanted to make it early in the morning to Lamar Valley.</p>
<p>As we drove through the beautiful Lamar Valley, my eyes were in search of the elusive predator, the grey wolf, which has made a remarkable comeback into Yellowstone after successful reintroduction. On our first visit to the valley the previous evening, I scanned the landscape with my binoculars but couldn&rsquo;t spot any movement, however, on this return journey, I spotted a couple of cars parked on the side of the road and I knew that I had to stop too. The road was along the edge of a mountain and we were at a height, overlooking the entire valley below. Here, through the scope of one of the wildlife photographers, I could see a family of grey wolf, far below. He had tracked it and focused on them and was kind enough to give us a peek when we stopped by. Any attempt to spot them through our binoculars would have not given us this view. This added a lot more excitement to our entire Yellowstone trip.</p>
<p>Camping at the various camp-grounds within the park is a great way to experience the natural beauty and observe the wildlife. Planning a stay at the camp-ground was easy enough, we realized; the key was to reach there by afternoon and reserve a spot to pitch our tent. After our first experience of reaching late at Pebble Creek Camp-ground, our next two night stays were successful at the Indian Creek and the Lewis Lake Camp-grounds The camp-grounds we chose were basic, not very large and were thankfully quiet, giving us some peace to experience the evenings after the hectic day of chasing geysers. The most memorable was sitting by the shore of Lewis Lake near the boat launch, enjoying a quiet sunset. The camp-grounds were frequented by several wildlife; At one of the camp-grounds, we saw a female elk wandering in the bushes. One early morning, when I stepped out of the tent, I encountered a shy white tailed deer. A snow shoe hare crossed our path and disappeared into the bushes as we walked exploring one of the trails around the camp-ground And, I could hear nocturnal creatures like owls and bats at night.</p>
<p>One morning, after three days, after visiting almost all of the geysers and caught up with our date with the Old Faithful, after being overwhelmed by the sheer scale of Mammoth Hot Springs and visiting the spectacular Grand Prismatic, the picture of which had initially inspired us to add Yellowstone to our list of must visit National Parks in the US, we exited the Park along the South Entrance stopping on our way briefly to get a magnificent view of the Grand Teton range. Just before exiting the park, as though making their presence felt, in case we have missed them, a large bison herd decided to walk right across the road crossing just in front of our car, creating a welcome traffic halt for several minutes.  If spotting the elusive grey wolf was not enough, the next day, while we drove at the peripheries of the park, after completing our three days stay inside, just there by the roadside, we spotted a herd of Pronghorns grazing. We immediately pulled over and observed them as they slowly moved away across a small hill.</p>
