					<p>After a nerve-wracking boda boda ride, we arrived at the gate of Nile River
Explorers parched, exhausted and covered in mud. What I saw inside immediately
lifted my mood; smiling faces, a bar overlooking the Nile and clean bathrooms.
All I needed was a refreshing shower and a chilled beer. Both were readily
available. Soon I found myself watching a group of macaques through my binoculars
as I sipped beer at one of the river-front tables. All around were tourists,
kayakers and adventure enthusiasts from all over the world, either recounting
their unforgettable rafting experience or all excited to take up the currents.
It was a perfect place for us to take a break, physically and mentally, from
the previous leg of travel and get ready for yet another new experience, this
time at a farm on the shores of river Nile. We were thankful to our kind host,
who had offered to pick us up from this place.
It was late evening, the sun had gone down magnificently, changing the view
from a bright green and blue painting to a grey silhouette. I turned around
as I heard the familiar sound of my name, when I realized it was our host.</p>
<p>Sitting in her SUV, with the windows rolled up, I could barely see the road
as we gathered up enormous dust driving along this unpaved road in darkness.
It was almost eight as we reached the farm, tired, yet excited about our new
home for the next couple of days. We were welcomed by smiling residents and
two extremely friendly dogs who seemed thrilled to meet us.</p>
<p>The farm was a work in progress, a beautiful space with a structure for the store
room and pantry, an outdoor kitchen, tents that served as sleeping quarters and
open air bathroom and dry toilets. We were free to pitch our tent at any spot
we found convenient, and in darkness, we started the process to setup our home.
Since it was drizzling a little, we had to hurry with the tent setup and secure
our luggage. Everything was spaced at a comfortable distance, giving us ample
privacy. I immediately fell in love with the place; it was safe, amidst
nature, completely open and unhindered by any sign of development. I drifted
off to sleep with the soothing sound of water flowing. Waking up in the middle of
the night was something I loved to do when camping. Watching the night sky,
listening to the sound of insects and feeling the cool night air was refreshing.
I would have loved to sit out all night and watch the sun come up, if I was not
so tired.</p>
<p>I cannot forget the view that awaited me as I woke up in the morning and came out
of my tent; the magnificent Nile in full flow in front of us, flowing wide. It was
breathtaking waking up to this sight. I immediately gathered my binoculars and headed
to the river, which was about 100 meters from where we camped. I was completely
blown away as I slowly manoeuvred through the thorny bushes and reached the shore.
It was like an ocean; vast. The rapids were in full force right ahead, welcoming
adventure enthusiasts. I scanned the area to catch sight of the water birds. There was
a boat at a distance with two men armed with their spears competing with the birds
for the fish. Through the binoculars, I noticed that they were stark naked. I turned
away and pointed my view towards a kingfisher. The roaring sound of the river was
astounding, masking any bird calls that I would have heard otherwise.</p>

<p>The morning sun was warm and bright,
indicating a hot day, although there were predictions of rain. Just a few meters
downriver, in the land adjacent to the farm, the shore was bald without any vegetation.
The river would flood and take away some land with it each year. The shoreline of
the farm, however in better condition. I could see that the
conservation efforts of our host had paid off, with at least some of the shore secured
against erosion. Protecting the shoreline with tall grasses that were
native to this place and planting shrubs and fast growing trees along the shore
was one of the main projects of our host. Besides the farm itself, our host
was working with other locals towards various afforestation projects that were
along the boundaries of the Nile river. As all conservation efforts, it was a
losing battle. Yet, there were slivers of hope in some places where the locals
had adopted this project as their own.</p>
<p>A short tour of the ongoing work in the farm brought me to the vegetable patch,
the fencing work and a poultry farm. Anyone who wished to volunteer had to offer their
skills and participate in one of these projects. Since we were going to be at the
farm for a very short period of time, we could only offer to help in a couple of areas
that did not require long term commitment. So after some discussions we were offered
some maintenance work that one if ambitious can call carpentry; fixing gaps between
wooden planks in the front porch of one of the semi-permanent tents.</p>
<p>A few feet away from all our volunteering action was a tiny yet perceptible gap
through the shrubbery and this led to what was called the bath area. Walking through
this trail led to a tiny gate-system which was all but a coloured string beyond
which one was permitted only if the string wasn&rsquo;t held in place. This honour
system is all that there was between privacy and being caught humming a tune
and thoroughly enjoying a bath in the safe confines of the shelter offered by
a tree, through which sunshine and bird-calls filtered through. Although initially I
was hesitant to let go of my inhibitions, it was me who volunteered first for
this out of the world experience.</p>
<p>On one of the days, soon after breakfast, we took a short walk across the farm,
crossing into the next land, following a well wooded path that dramatically
opened up into a vast undulating landscape. We climbed a small hillock that
gave excellent views of the Nile. The fact that there was very less or almost
no other people around heightened my senses; I could feel the river roaring below,
with eddies and currents, in full force. It started drizzling and this made it
all the more exciting to watch the river in rain. I wished that I knew some
basics of rafting so I could muster up the courage to go into the waters with
the canoes, which our host offered us. It must be such an exhilarating experience getting
into the rough, vast water, with a narrow canoe that would get tossed and
turned as it hit the currents. But that&rsquo;s probably something for another time.</p>
