					<p>Very soon, the driver of our car sounded excited and stopped the car by the side
of the road. Soon, we were all looking in the direction where he was looking. He had spotted
some furry animals; extremely cute rodents. 5 or 6 young ones of the Capybara.
The mother was nearby, quite large in comparison. Soon she and her flock disappeared
into a burrow. This was our first sighting of Capybaras and we were extremely
happy to see them from so near, just by the side of the road. It was a lucky start to
what was actually a bird watching
tour in the Bolivian Amazon cloud forests of Madidi National Park. We had booked this tour
with the Sadiri lodge which was quite a distance away by road from the small town of
Rurrenabaque.</p>
<p>This road journey from Rurrenabaque to Sadiri, through the Madidi National Park, was itself
a great chance to see the beautiful landscape. Numerous streams crossed our path and fortunately,
they were shallow enough so that our car managed to easily wade through. At Tumupasa, our guide,
Ricardo bought some fresh Njaranja (Oranges) and Bananas. It was already
lunchtime but lunch was at least two hours away at our final destination for the
day at the San Jose de Uchupiamonas community. We would briefly visit our lodge to just deposit
our backpacks and carry a smaller pack for the three day trek through the jungle.
The fruits were welcome and we devoured it along with some other snacks we had packed, which
we shared with the crew. We were six in the car, the two of us, Ricardo, our guide, his wife Maria,
who was responsible for feeding us, both of whom were from the community of San Jose de Uchupiamonas,
Jorge the driver, and Gera, the staff from Sadiri who was kind enough to
accompany us to bridge any communication gaps that the language might cause, she was greatly
instrumental in putting together an exciting itinerary tailor made for us.</p>
<p>Even while we were eating, Ricardo&rsquo;s eyes and ears were always tuned to birds and he would keep
telling us the names of birds he was spotting. And he would never tire
of watching birds and identifying them. Although I was grateful for this genuine interest
he showed, I have to admit that I was too tired to match his enthusiasm. But his being
that way actually helped my cause; ensuring that I put my best on the table too, so as
to have a fruitful birdwatching tour. Even before we entered the forests, he had shown us several
birds. This, to a great extent kept our hunger pangs at bay and made the otherwise road
trip exciting.</p>
<p>Around 3pm, we reached the remote village of the community of San Jose de Uchupiamonas
It was a very rustic, relaxed place with lots of fruiting trees and birds around. We were hosted
for lunch at Senora Nelli&rsquo;s house where we were offered freshly squeezed juice
and a sumptuous lunch consisting of Banana flower soup, rice, pulses, salad and
a dessert. Everything was freshly cooked with local ingredients, simple, yet flavourful and
they tried their best to offer the Amazonian experience to us, even with our dietary constraints, which
they were prepared to cater to. We were famished and gleefully devoured the tasty food that was on
offer. Although it was tempting to just stay back here and rest for the day, our trip had just begun
and our campsite that Gera had chosen for us for the night halt was another two hours and a boat-ride
away. Thanking our kind hosts, we drove for another short distance till the river, from where, we would
begin our Amazonian adventure.</p>
<p>The next morning, we returned from the campsite and were back at San Jose De Uchupiamonas
around 11am and were offered a tour of the village by Ricardo. He took us around the
community including into a few homes. While he explained some local processes like de-husking
paddy manually with a pounding staff, we pointed out to him that this is exactly what we
did in Indian villages back home. We could exchange our local knowledge with theirs and
surprise them with how similar some of these were! It was also evident that most of the
tourists who came to the village came from the first-world countries such as the U.S, U.K;
countries that had completely lost touch with nature, tradition and past which meant
the visitors gawked a bit more when certain traditional systems were on display. It was
a bit of learning for Ricardo himself that in the eastern cultures such as India, the
traditional systems still existed side by side along with what we consider an overrun
of the modern.</p>
<p>We visited the local school, where we got a brief on how it was run, what were the issues
and political influences that caused problems here. The life of the people here is hard;
they live in the middle of the forest, with the nearest town two hours away. The river
is one of the most important transport systems. We interacted briefly with the children,
one of whom was making friendship bands with wild seeds found in the surroundings. Apart
from what the tourism has offered them - bringing in better quality homes and a few more
facilities and exposure - their main way of living is by subsistence farming; growing
some fruits, vegetables, cocoa, and also poultry and fishing.</p>
<p>We got some insight into the dynamics of how this community was formed and how it was
sustained by the tourism due to Chalalan and Sadiri. The founder of Sadiri, Ruth Alipaz,
who is from the same community who got a chance to go out and become an entrepreneur
returned to setup this lodge as a means of sustainable tourism employing locals for
more than 90% of the work and ensuring the money returns to the community. Everyone
we met spoke highly of this intervention and the skills that they have been taught part
of the training. Ricardo was chosen to get in depth training in bird watching which
meets international standards. Some of the women like Nelli and Maria were trained as
chefs who can prepare various cuisines. A few others in work like construction, repairs
etc. The objective of all this was to discourage loggers who are pillaging the forests
illegally and poachers who are destroying the biodiversity, by instead promoting
eco-tourism which is community driven and sustainable.</p>
<p>These meet-ups, even if in short-bursts, with this small, local and rooted community was
a huge learning experience for us. Before we parted, we had a shower and had one last
meal at Nelli&rsquo;s home; a sumptuous lunch consisting of vegetable soup, pineapple
juice, boiled yucca, mani curry (peanut sauce with yucca), boiled rice and to top it,
a cooked banana dessert. We were offered hammocks to take our afternoon siesta into which
we immediately fell asleep. After a short nap, we were ready for our walk to our next
campsite.</p>
