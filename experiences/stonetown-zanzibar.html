					<p>Just outside, you find yourself in a typical African town, with people getting about their routine work. There is traffic, pollution, vehicles honking, hawkers selling everything from bread, fruits, vegetables, newspaper to bags, shoes, clothes and people haggling for a good bargain; burqa clad school girls gossiping in small groups, giggling, waiting for their bus; high school boys trying to look like grown up men, wearing their traditional cap and gown, but their their school bags giving them away. Women clad in black burqas and colourful scarves — shocking pink, bright yellow, parrot green and blood red, walking down the busy streets.</p>
<p>You take a quick turn into one of the inner streets and you are instantly teleported into a totally different world. A world reminiscent of Arabian night stories, of ancient colonial buildings with intricately carved wooden door and window frames, of people walking along narrow cobblestone alleys, bicycles sounding their bell whizzing past you. Nothing other than the modern scooters and mobile phones would give away the time frame of this town — the eponymous stone town of Zanzibar. It looks like a town that somehow slept through the development that the world around it went through, and over time, was forgotten. It is a precious piece of land now completely taken over by tourism, with major hotels competing for prime space and attention. Although Zanzibar belongs to Tanzania, Africa, it is entirely different from the rest of Tanzania and East Africa — the people, the art, the culture, the flavours, the smell, everything about Zanzibar reminds you of middle eastern and Indian culture.</p>

<p>A walk through this labyrinth of pathways can completely get you disoriented and make the best of the navigators lose their way. On a map, these narrow pathways look as complex as our nervous system, with a web of wiry streets connecting each other. It is best to wander through them with infinite time and patience and throw away the map. You are sure to get lost despite having one. But then, getting lost is one of the best ways to experience the best of Stone Town. You come here to forget yourself, forget everything and get completely lost in time. Since the roads are narrow, only two wheelers and bicycles are allowed. The streets join one another every hundred meters or so and a bend in the road every twenty or thirty meters.</p>

<p>It is hard to walk past any building without stopping and admiring its ancient architecture and history. If you wait long enough these buildings might tell you a story. Most of them are dilapidated and the lucky ones which are renovated are now boutique hotels charging premium prices. The cracked plaster, the broken wooden window pane, the dusty worn out wooden doors, the mesh of electric wires hanging messily, the chipped off paint from buildings, are all intriguing. They are all photogenic if you can see their hidden beauty, like an charming old woman with wrinkles and grey hair. The buildings are one or two storeyed, built of bricks with plaster, painted with limestone, so they are shades of white and off white, with a dash of bright blue or yellow paint here and there. The doors are of solid wood, with brass inlays and intricate carvings on the door frames. The window panes are made of wood, with wooden doors. Modern materials like glass or steel are hardly seen. Some of the buildings have a Moghul or Arabic influence with Jaali work and arches incorporated into their designs. The stairs leading to the buildings are of stone or cement. Each building has a massive double door that is quite sturdy. And several windows especially in the upper storeys. Although most of these are now converted to curio stores, antique shops or shops selling various touristy stuff, there are still buildings where people are living and leading their normal lives.</p>
<p>If you enter any of these buildings (some are restaurants), the interiors are equally appealing and most of them have worked hard to maintain the antiquity of the building. The high roof ceiling, the stony or cemented stairways paved with red-oxide or cement, small cozy rooms with old mosaic or red oxide flooring, everything reminds you of your grandmother’s homes. The discoloured brass door knobs, the door handles, painted glass lamp shades, wooden tables, benches with carvings, shelves, mirror stands, window panes, wooden cot and frame, everything having motifs of flowers, designs, carvings. The natural history museum has a tiny wooden door on the wall, which opens to a compartment that holds four old round black knobbed light switches. As all old buildings, the wiring is more recent, and can be found pinned to the wall and runs across the room on all the walls and is plastered with a fresh coat of limestone or paint. Some newer buildings that have come up have generously borrowed from the ancient architecture to retain the same old world charm of their neighbourhood. All the Stone Town offices and government buildings are housed in aesthetic old buildings refurbished with fresh white coat of paint. Even the storm drain covers made of metal have this architecture theme and “Stone town conservation development authority Zanzibar” embossed on it.</p>

<p>As I walk through the cool, narrow alleys of Stone Town, I am drawn by its raw beauty. A burqa clad woman wearing bright yellow scarf walks briskly past me. A couple of shy school girls in uniform, wearing white scarves dart across the street. I hear cycle bell ringing and I realize that a bicycle is coming right behind me at full speed, so I step aside. A couple of middle aged men with greying hair are sitting in front of their shop and enjoying their tea. A man is pulling a wooden cart loaded with some luggage. Several women are seen walking about, busy with their daily routines. Women in twos and threes sitting on the verandah outside their houses gossiping, men sitting on the porch chatting. A man wearing a colourful traditional cap is talking loudly on his mobile phone, the contrast of the old and new visible starkly here. I walk past a massive white building, a bank, but cannot help noticing its door frame made of intricately carved wood. I see a parking note outside the building that says “Vespas only”, I see five Vespa scooters parked in front of this sign and a Honda Deo parked on the opposite side of the door. Vespas seem to have a special preference on these streets.</p>

<p>An old man is sitting on a sofa outside his home, wearing a red coloured traditional cap and a white robe. Another person, probably his friend is sitting opposite him on a wooden chair. I walk past a woman in a burqa who greeted me with “jambo”, she was sitting on the side of the road, begging for money. I walk into a deserted alley, with only a toddler riding his tricycle on the road, he curiously stares at us and runs away as we approach. I reach a busy intersection of three or four streets where there is a date palm tree and a wooden pole on which a telephone is hung at a height and a board next to it that reads “make free international calls here”; an elaborate prank perhaps and to retain the mystery, I did not bother to try. All around this tree on the sides were vegetable and fruit vendors selling oranges, peaches, avocados, lemons, pears, apples, greens, cucumbers, onions and tomatoes. There were other shops selling colourful clothes, jewellery, footwear. There were more locals than tourists on some of the streets as it was getting hotter and approaching noon.</p>

<p>In some of the shops, or what actually seemed like studios or workshops, the carpenters and artisans were busy with their work. There were huge logs of wood, wooden shavings, pieces strewn all around. They were making door frames, wooden carving, some were making small wooden boxes with brass inlays to be sold in the souvenir shops. Small wooden spice boxes, jewellery boxes, wooden masks, wooden frames, mirrors and photo frames with carvings, there were a lot of items made of wood for sale. One shop sold animal hides, I even saw a few monitor lizard hides hanging outside. Many stores sold beaded jewellery that Masai are famous for, Masai paintings that depict zebra, giraffe, cheetah, Masai warriors with their armour. Some stores sold colourful printed pyjamas, tunics, scarfs, t-shirts with Zanzibar, Hakuna Matata, Jambo, Tanzania written on them, football jerseys. A black and white cat ran across the street, another grey striped one was lying down on the side lazily, stretching. They were totally at home there. A light brown cat with a bushy tail looked at me, demandingly.</p>

<p>Before I came here, having read a lot of reviews about Zanzibar, Stone town, an impression had crept in my head about the touts who try to harass you and rip you off. It was written over and over again by so many tourists that I remember the first time I walked through Stone town, I was stiff and wary of anyone who even walked past me or looked at me, silently accusing every man to be a tout. But after a few minutes I was relaxed when I realized that it was not the case. What is true, however, was that the touts somehow hung around the periphery of Stone town, near the popular monuments, near the beach, Forodhani Gardens or fort area. In a way, they were all like bouncers near the gates of all lanes leading into Stone Town. But once I was inside, I felt free. I felt safer and comfortable walking around, taking pictures. I realized that I was surrounded by locals, residents of stone town to whom I might be a nuisance, walking in front of their houses and peering into their lives. They were neither aggressive nor overly friendly. They just stoically went about their lives and accepted the over enthusiastic tourist as a part of it. This made me go back again and again into those lanes and discover new facets of it each time.</p>
<p>I ran into boys playing football at an empty square at the intersection of five lanes, with the backdrop of a mosque, people gathering silently for prayer during Namaz time. I realized that Stone Town was not just a touristy place. There were two sides to it. The residents of Stone Town go about their normal lives, with no gains from tourism. At one instance, I happened to enter a street that was filled with people wearing white burqas and silently sitting around a person reading from the Quran. Whether it was a prayer gathering or a funeral prayer, I was not sure. Out of respect, I backed out silently.</p>
<p>Whenever I was tired of people offering me taxis or prison-island tours or simply asking “what is your plan? what is your plan? huh?” (one guy had the guts to walk up to me as I was simply walking on the street and pose this difficult question, to which I was so taken aback that I felt almost ashamed that I did not really have a good plan to share with him) that I would jump into the nearest lane into Stone Town and escape them. And the best way to deal with these touts was to confidently and patiently answer all the questions affirmatively and assure them that I went to the spice tour, I just did the prison island tour and whatever else that he thought was a vital part of our itinerary, I had just completed. And after he ran out of offers he would simply say great, enjoy and walk away. At the beginning it was difficult to lie but slowly as I started doing it, I became more confident, almost to start believing that I had actually done these tours.</p>

<p>The nearby beautiful Forodhani Gardens was a regular walk in the park during the day but totally transformed by night. A nicely maintained public park that is a breathing space for tourists and locals alike. The cafes, floating restaurants, the numerous benches in the park all give a fabulous view of the ocean with the dhow boats sailing along frequently. A great place to relax after walking through the stone town, the blue ocean immediately draws you towards these gardens. The dramatic sunset provides a wonderful opening act to the festivities that will begin soon afterwards. It is most soothing to sit on one of the benches soaking in the orange glow of the sunset and if we are lucky catch a dhow sailing exactly in front of the sunset forming a picture perfect scenery that graces many a walls of Zanzibar hotels. Evening is also a time for teenage boys to play football on the beach or swim or dive into the water, thereby displaying their masculinity and showing off their talent to the shy local girls and tourists. They even got into an impromptu performance of somersault and freestyle dancing on one of the evenings.</p>

<p>The crowd starts to gather as it gets dark and the excitement starts to build up as the stalls come up one by one. The upcoming feast is heralded by the cats, who get active and restless towards this time. The pushcarts line up and start arranging their wares for the grand banquet. Almost every stall sells the same kind of food, but people definitely have their favourites. As you walk past their stall, they invite you, coax you, try to entice you with the aromas coming from the food they are cooking. It is a mega street food festival that unveils everyday here starting after sundown. People flock to taste the Shwarmas, Zanzibari pizzas, Urojos and other local delicacies freshly cooked and laid out. The stalls are ready to serve you at your favourite spots. Each chef has his unique way of presentation and style. The mouthwatering spicy food is definitely the highlight of this spice island. The party goes on till midnight till the crowds die down.</p>
