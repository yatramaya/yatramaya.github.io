					<p>It wasn&rsquo;t an unusual year by any standards. And if the changes in climate had
already manifested into something palpable, then we did not know about it. We
were three of us, and one of us was local.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should have snowed by now&rdquo;, Brajesh said as he gestured us to pick up our
two glasses of piping hot tea that were on a steel plate. He was already sipping
his. It was something that I least expected; to be sitting in the front row of a
local bus in Manali at 4am in the morning and being treated to the hospitality
of a very friendly driver. The previous 13 hours were spent trying to not fall
off my seat either due to exhaustion or due to the fact that he was completing the
final bone-breaking lap of our journey from Chandigarh to Manali.</p>
<p>Back at Chandigarh when we boarded the bus, I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect. We
did not have any reservations and the bus stand betrayed in a very disappointing
fashion the fact that it was peak travel season and thus exposed our unpreparedness.
It was at the very last minute that we got two seats on a local bus. Immediately
upon entering it, we met a curt man whom we heard Brajesh call Ustad. It was my
actions though, that invited Ustad&rsquo;s admonishing remarks. I had inadvertently
spread my luggage in a seat that was to accommodate three instead of just us two.
It was then that I first noticed Brajesh&rsquo;s face. He turned around from his
driver&rsquo;s seat to inspect who it was that unleashed Ustad&rsquo;s fury; perhaps a rarity,
we can never know.</p>
<p>When the bus rolled into the dark and gloomy bus stand at Manali there was just
two or three large halogen lamps that lit up the area. The fact that Manali
was surrounded by Himalayan beauty would be deemed a lie by anyone who has never
seen it in sunlight. And sunlight was a few hours away. We had booked a hotel
nearby and were pretty sure that it was going to be a challenge to check-in there so
early, let alone find it once we leave the dimly lit premises of the bus stand.
I was thinking about all this while simultaneously yanking our luggage from
underneath the seats when Brajesh tapped on my shoulder as he stepped out of
his own seat, carefully stepping out of the way of the heated engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you both from?&rdquo;, he asked</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bangalore&rdquo;, I replied</p>
<p>&ldquo;First time in Manali?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then went on to ask fundamental questions which at first seemed a bit odd
because typically at this point he would get off the bus and go his way, to
perhaps talk to his other colleagues who were standing close by in the dark
and sipping hot tea while eating bread-omlettes and we would drag ourselves
out hesitantly and walk into the uninviting terrain of a damp and cold bus stand
waiting for the sun to rise. But that is not what happened. Brajesh asked us to
pause what we were doing and sat beside us and rather firmly explained that it
was too early to walk out and find the hotel. Instead, like sensible people, we
should sip hot tea with him, in the warmer confines of the bus till day break and
spend the time chit chatting. I was taken aback, yet moved by his kindness towards
total strangers.</p>
<p>So we did exactly that. He told us that he was from Haryana, was married and
had one child. To his deeper question of why we were here, I told him that we wanted to
experience a snowfall. He was rather amused to know that we hadn&rsquo;t seen a snowfall and
at the same time, and understandably so - he being a driver - was least
interested in a snowfall. It was customary to mockingly say &ldquo;You have not seen
a snowfall!&rdquo;, so he did. But he couldn&rsquo;t hide his empathy, as if he had just
met someone who had not seen water boil or a leaf fall. It was also then he
realized that Manali hadn&rsquo;t received its snowfall yet. And he was repeating
that point yet again after getting off the bus for a few minutes to buy tea
for all of us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if snow falls now, then you won&rsquo;t be able to go to Keylong&rdquo;, he said, while
we sipped the hot tea and pretended to be a group of smokers huddling around.
What he said is something I had thought about and had to deal with. The Rohtang Pass
closed every year during heavy snowfall and one always had to choose between
enjoying a white-carpet around the valleys or crossing over the pass and having
more terrain to cover. Brajesh meanwhile told us stories about the perils of
driving in the snow and his own experiences with it. We shared whatever little
we could about ourselves and from our parts of the world. We exchanged phone
numbers and he insisted that we call him when we travelled to Haryana some day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not snow there in my home-town&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;But it is beautiful. I can
show you around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversations and two rounds of tea seemed to have the desired effect.
Sunrise was thoroughly expedited and it only took the first few rays to arrive
when as if jolted by a sense of duty Brajesh got up and announced that it was
time to end our little meeting of complete strangers. When we split, I felt
terrible that it had to end but also knew it had to. Brajesh was compelled
by his humanity to not let two passengers of his - out of their naivety - wander
off into the cold and dark by-lanes of Manali. He was also curious. Our paths crossed
and it was what it was, a momentary yet substantial exchange of life stories. We had
ours, he had his. After a few rounds of saying our byes he walked towards his
friends to share embellished versions of the stories with them while we trudged
off down the road in the general direction of our hotel room.</p>
<p>It was about 10 days later back in my home-town that I received a call on my phone while in the
middle of a mundane and routine meeting. I excused myself and stepped out to
speak to the man at the other end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brajesh Ji!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sirji&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;it is heavy snow here right now. I am at Manali bus stand&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wah&rdquo;, I said, &ldquo;We missed it. We returned home two days ago&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It snowed so much today and I remembered both of you&rdquo;, he re-emphasized why it
was he called. These weren&rsquo;t the days of smartphones and lacking any ability
to actually visually convey what he felt, he paused for a bit as if in that
silence I would make an attempt to hear the gentle sounds of tiny little snow
flakes that were hitting his weary feet. I could hear a not so gentle breeze
though. That was enough. And the gesture was enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long then. I have to go. Remember Sirji. Haryana. Anytime&rdquo;, he said. We have never gone to
Haryana. I even lost his number. But I dream of the day when we once do go there
and run into him all over again on a damp, cold early morning. Humanity like
that is everlasting and perpetual and it is never hard to find it when I open
up myself by travelling.</p>
