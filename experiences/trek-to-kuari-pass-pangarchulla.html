					<p>My back was unaccustomed to the heavy load. It was more than a year
since I had been on any serious multi-day hike. And, even though we
had hired a couple of porters and a guide to carry the camping equipment and
the cooking essentials, even the personal items that I had signed up to
haul was seeming heavier than I had imagined. The moment I got out of the
jeep and started walking through the narrow lanes of the village Dhak, two thoughts
were on my mind. One was that for the next seven days it would just be the seven of
us in the midst of the mighty Himalayas, far away from civilization. And for the
first time - in these parts -, I would be living out of a tent. The other, was the
nagging thought of the backpack that was dragging me down and slowing my pace. I adjusted the
straps of the backpack, tried to take a deep breath and start climbing the
steep steps that were carved out of mud and laden with rounded boulders. My heart
was pounding and I could hear nothing but my footsteps and my heartbeat for
stretches of time. The feeling that I always experience at the beginning of a trek -
tired limbs that have been shocked out of their comfort of sitting in a moving
vehicle, reluctant, hesitant mind that is anxious about the great distances ahead
and, an excitement of being one with nature, the adrenaline rush of being subjected
to the ultimate test of one&rsquo;s endurance.</p>
<p>I could see a small stream flowing through this village, with vegetables
grown on either side of it in small plots of land. The people were probably
used to trekkers, so did not pay much attention to our group. Small children playing
on the front yard of their homes gave us quick glances and shy smiles, without
making direct eye contact. I smiled at them as I walked by. Our guide,
Dinesh, was a local, he seemed to know their language and made small conversations
as we passed by a few houses. Two others walking with us were from this very<br>
village and hence, had joined us only a few minutes ago. I could see that the
children were used to some goodies that trekkers had spoilt them with; it was evident
that they were expecting snacks or money from us, which we politely side-stepped
with help from Dinesh. Having been on treks and faced with this dilemma, knowing fully
the repercussions of displaying our gear in front of unassuming villagers, I had overcome
this awkward situation and the ensuing guilt by consoling myself that I was doing the
right thing under the circumstances, which was, not to hand out freebies to children.</p>

<p>Some of the houses looked quite old, with carved wooden pillars and
similar roofing of flat tiles. There were a few new houses getting constructed, with
stone and mud walls and sloping roofs. The village itself was relatively clean except
for the plastic litter that was strewn around the shops and the water sources, which
I am sure was a result of the increasing trekker traffic in this area. We continued
our walk, and in about twenty minutes, we were out of the village and into a well wooded
area. The trail from here was going up a hill. So we climbed, under the tree cover.
It was around 10 in the morning and we had set off after a good breakfast. The hike
itself had started to become enjoyable and I was getting used to my clothes, my
jacket, my shoes , and of course, my backpack. These would be my companions for the
next few days. I remembered how enjoyable the experience of trekking is; the tiredness,
the aching muscles, the occasional cool sip of water, the short breaks to admire
an insect or a fallen leaf or a butterfly, the placing of one foot in front of another;
this rhythm was something I was looking forward to. The climb itself was quite steep.
Although the path was meandering around the hill, some short-cut sections cut through
to gain time was making me more tired. But it was an easy trek, by my standards.</p>
<p>The trees were old, mostly Walnut - <em>Akrot</em> in local language - with some of them
several feet wide with their roots spread for several meters all around. Some of these
roots provided comfortable seating during breaks in the shade of these large trees. It was
not the season for the nuts, hence, all we found in evidence were a few empty walnut shells at the base
of the trees, discarded by squirrels, probably. A stream was flowing at a distance
below, probably the upstream section of the same one I saw in the village. We were soon
approaching the meadows that were beyond this tree cover. The first day of walk was neither
strenuous nor long and probably lasted only a couple of hours at a comfortable pace. We would
soon approach our first campsite at <em>Akrotghetta</em>. Walking through the meadows, the view
opened up and for the first time and I realized we were surrounded by snow capped mountains.
The imposing presence of Dronagiri to the North would stay with us
during the entire duration of the trek.</p>
<p>Our efficient and thoughtful porters and the cook had
walked a few paces ahead and had already started setting up tents. We chose a good,
flat place for the tent and pitched ours. They took charge of the kitchen and throughout
this trek we would enjoy freshly cooked, hearty meals, tea and snacks.
Having been on treks that were either in lodges, with fixed meals, or
on our own, with mostly dry cold food and basic Khichdi and soups, this arrangement of
accompanying cooks was sort of a luxury we had not accounted for, but would appreciate and
enjoy every bit of. Apart from our tent for three, there was a kitchen tent, which also
served as sleeping place for two of them, and another dining tent, which were used by two
more to sleep at night. The arrangements were simple and served the basic purpose it
was intended for.</p>

<p>Since it was still mid-day, I was looking forward for some short walks around the campsite
and indulge in photography of the snow covered peaks and the beautiful grasslands. The sun
was still up, so I did not feel very cold yet. But at 4pm, the winds started blowing and along
with it, brought some chills. The sleeping bags provided were the life-saver, it was so warm that once
I got into it, it took just ten minutes for me to feel comfortable, and sometimes (thankfully) warm too.
The weather was pleasant and the skies clear. Towards evening, a couple of kids from the
village walked up to our tent and peered inside out of curiosity. I just smiled at them as
I did not speak their language. They just hung around the kitchen tent for their share of
biscuits and then ran downhill. It seemed like they exactly knew the tea-time of trekking
groups and arrived just in time for the snacks.</p>
<p>Our trekking guide, Dinesh, was young, friendly and
playful, he was not very strict and was eager to ensure that we were satisfied with all the
arrangements. However, once we started discussing the next day&rsquo;s plan and schedule, his face
would stiffen, he would put up a stern expression and speak to us very seriously. The playfulness
displayed a few seconds ago would completely vanish, replaced by maturity and discipline.
This was something that I admired in him, because, I wanted to be sure that we had entrusted
our lives with someone who knew well what he was doing. Dinesh&rsquo;s brother Rakesh, who was one
of the porters and had accompanied us to learn the drill from his brother, was soft-
spoken and smiling. He served us all our meals and helped around in the kitchen. Birender, a
shy person, who had not spoken much to us, other than to say his name, would accompany us on our
further climbs. Kapil, the cook and Rakesh would stay back and ensure that the campsite was
taken care of and the meals were ready before we started the trek and before we arrived at the
campsite after the trek each day.</p>

<p>The next day, being another short trek to the second base camp, we were in no hurry to pack up
and leave. I however woke up early to see the sun rise and catch the first light on the face
of the mountains. We were offered hot tea and biscuits, which was welcomed by everyone. We took
time to change into trekking clothes, pack the sleeping bags, pack our backpacks and then
proceed for breakfast. I was surprised to be served <em>Aloo Parantha</em>, something that I had got used
to during my stay in Joshimath, however, was not expecting them to arrange it
during a trek! Kapil was an excellent cook, who ensured that we had variety on each day of the
trek and everything tasted fresh and delicious. I was wondering how they were managing to
procure fresh vegetables, provisions for all our elaborate meals. I later realized that we
were hardly three to four hours from the trail-head and they considered it
a stroll to run down and fetch anything that was missed. I was not completely happy with the
indulgence, but I was only thankful for their hospitality, as the food kept us in good spirits
throughout the trek.</p>

<p>We set off further up the meadows towards a larger spread of grasslands ( very generically )
called <em>Bugyal</em>. This was probably the most beautiful and picture-perfect campsite I have
ever camped on. It would become our home for the next 4 days, until we completed both the treks. Having got used to
the walking and sufficiently warmed up the previous day, I found the second day of trek to
be easier. We had the beautiful scenery to distract us as a bonus. The path we were taking
was a common route for herders who would take their livestock up and down everyday
from the village below. Closer to our campsite, we saw a large herd of sheep, easily
400 to 500, accompanied by shepherds and sheep dogs. Our arrival was so well timed in fact that I saw one
of them giving birth to a young one right in front of us; what a moment it was! Some of them were shy
and moved away when we were photographing them,
while some large ones came closer for inspection. This herd would stay right next to our
campsite for the next couple of days. We would hear the sheep bleat all night. And the sheep-dog;
he  would adopt us during our entire stay and sleep just outside our tent, ignoring the
sheep, the one job he had.</p>

<p>We later learnt from Dinesh that the site we had originally planned out for the second day,
namely Khullara, was now off-limits for trekkers
and the government was not giving permits to camp there. By evening when we took a walk
to see these beautiful grasslands and we understood why. The grassland was vast,
spanning about half a kilometre, a flat land, with slight undulations, but overall very even,
covered with grass. The landscape was dotted with trees bearing colourful flowers and leaves.
A stream with pristine, sparkling water flowing right in the middle of the meadow,
separated it into two. The path passed further right through this beautiful landscape.
There was a small stone bridge over the stream at one place. I could
imagine how this unique ecosystem was disturbed with several tents and hundreds of people
walking all over the grass every season. The large trekking groups consist of several
tents and accompanying paraphernalia to make trekkers comfortable. All this would put
undue load on the grassland ecosystem and slowly; they were dying. The government, in a
desperate effort to save this unique landscape and maintain it in pristine condition, had
brought about a ban on camping here. We were happy that these meadows would be free
from human footsteps and would continue to look beautiful for years.</p>

<p>One our return to camp, we found it way cooler than the previous campsite. And we were rewarded
with breathtaking views of Neelkanth, Hathi Ghoda and other peaks right outside our tent door. That
night, over a sumptuous dinner of Dhal, Roti, rice and Brinjal curry, we discussed our next day, which
would be the Kuari Pass trek. We woke up early and started off in the dark with packed
breakfast and lunch. Since the winds were strong at night, we hoped for a clear day. The moon
was out when we woke up early the next morning. The snow covered mountains were faintly
visible in that moonlight, casting shadows, and everything was still except for some
activity in the kitchen tent. We quickly packed our day packs and got ready
for our trek to Kuari Pass.</p>
<p>The initial part of the walk was difficult. Once we went past Khullara, a steep
climb over boulders of various sizes made our walk slower and unsteady. I carefully
stepped on each stone to assure a firm footing before moving my other foot, and all
this manoeuvrer was in darkness with headlamps. It was a blessing that we had explored some
of this terrain the previous evening during our walk, so we could remember some parts
of the trail that were especially tricky. Dinesh and Birender accompanied us, each at
either end of the group, making sure that we were catching up. All of us carried light
day packs, consisting of mostly gaiters, crampons and our lunch packets. We carried two litres of
water each, which we found to be necessary. It was strenuous compared to the last couple
of days of easy walking through well marked trails. I named this area with
the boulders and uneven terrain, with hardly any scenery to enjoy in the darkness,
as &lsquo;drudgery area&rsquo;. In most treks, we tend to encounter at least one such stretch that
is unpleasant, extremely difficult and does not reward us with views.</p>

<p>What I was looking forward to eagerly, was for the sun to rise. We took a short break
at an clearing to see the sun rise over the magnificent snow covered mountains. It
gave us fresh energy to continue the trek. Also now that I could see better, it
greatly helped keep my pace with Dinesh. The next section, after the &ldquo;drudgery stretch&rdquo;,
was a large valley with the inviting, cooling waters of a stream right at the edge
where we were, as if placed there as our first little challenge. We crossed this stream
over treacherous boulders and started walking in the vast plain. The terrain
was easier than the section we had just completed. The trail crossed
the valley and we started climbing steeply along the slopes of a hill, that was
covered with boulders. On the slopes, the snow had mostly melted, leaving behind patches of
slush covered with grass. Some of us had got hungry and had munched on the packed food
along the way. Then, we made an official stop to eat. The <em>Aloo Parantha</em> tasted heavenly.
By this time we had already ascended more than 200 meters. We would now move
progressively to higher altitudes with each crossing of the mountain. We walked
along the top ridge of a mountain with brilliant views on either side, with the
valley far below us now.</p>

<p>The morning sun had warmed me sufficiently and I peeled off the warm jacket.
The air was thinner and I could breathe more easily. We were promised a clear day
and I was thankful for that. Kuari Pass is like a panorama, where you can stand at
one point and witness huge peaks all around. Further, we
walked on to climb another steep mountain, after which we could see the trail
go through snow, we sat at the edge of this mountain, got our gaiters and crampons
ready. The next part of the trail would be through snow, this was an experience
that I had never had before, and something that I was looking forward to with
eagerness and apprehension. The scenery was so beautiful, vast stretches of snow
all around, with no trail defined. We could have got easily lost in ten minutes
had it not been for our guide. Dinesh recounted stories of trekkers and porters
who had got lost in a storm here after it had become dark. Specifically, he
remembered the one about sending a person to descend to the campsite which was
estimated to be only a few minutes away, but to everyone&rsquo;s horror him wandering in
circles for more than two hours, and somehow (thankfully) managing to reach
his destination; all this without having a clue as to where he went. The moral of
the story was simple; that things could go really wrong and only luck could
result in a happy ending sometimes. With such dreadful stories, we continued our
hike thanking the weather we had so far.</p>

<p>I found walking on snow the most tedious. Firstly, we do not have any idea where we are
stepping, it is hard to gauge. It can only be through trial and error and experience
of several expeditions that we can start to recognize the snow. We were severely
dependent on our guides during this exercise. When the snow was soft, and I was unsure of
how deep my leg would sink, so it seemed prudent to secure one foot before engaging
the next. On the other hand, if the snow had hardened, then my feet would slip and on
narrow trails over ridges this could be dangerous. All the enjoyment of seeing the snow and the anticipation of
walking on it, wearing crampons, disappeared after walking for ten steps. The crampons
were invaluable in this whole exercise, I realized. Although it was difficult to
walk on surfaces where the snow had melted, like some rocks that we had to navigate
in our path in between two stretches of snow, where we still had the crampons on,
there was no replacement for a good pair of crampons, on snow. With some practice and
newfound confidence, I started moving without anxiety, with a surer foot. Although,
in tricky situations, Birender was always behind to lend a quick, strong arm to hold
on to. It was here that I realized how well equipped he was in dealing with difficult
situations and focusing on our safety at all times. Dinesh had to lead the way and
find the right path in the snow, because there was no visible trail, he also had to
test the surface to see if it slips or whether it will sink into a pit. While he was
focused on that, Birender ensured all three of us were safe and watched over us
if one of us needed any help in navigating some difficult patches. He also opened up
and shared some of his stories and trekking experiences.</p>
<p>Most of this part of the trek was not steep, so it was easy on the lungs, so once we
got used to the terrain, we could move a little faster. We reached a valley, where the
trail split into two, with the left arm leading towards the Pangarchulla and the
right one towards Kuari Pass. Today, we had to take the right arm. There was a small
shrine on our path, this was a temple two feet tall built with stones piled up. This was
also the earlier Advanced Base Camp for Pangarchulla summit, which we could not take
benefit of because this campsite was banned too, very recently. We would have tot trek
all the way back to camp and retrace a lot of this day again, tomorrow to attempt
Pangarchulla, which we felt was unfair, and greatly reduced
chances of a successful summit. But that was how it was going to be.</p>

		</figure>
	


<p>Beyond this valley of snow, we had one more climb on a snow clad mountain slope to
reach probably the highest point in the trek. As it was the norm, or as I thought it
was, destinations and summits collide, so I inquired with Dinesh if we were at Kuari
Pass. But he, disappointingly for me pointed ahead and said that we were yet to
get there. We took a break since we found it a nice spot to eat our lunch. However, it
was very windy and some of us had mild symptoms of altitude sickness, like loss of appetite. I was very
hungry and was waiting to eat the <em>Roti</em> and <em>Aloo Gobi curry</em> that Kapil had packed for
us in an aluminium foil. We also met a man, a local, who was busy looking for a specific
fungi. He was a loner that day, but Dinesh mentioned that in the cold season there
would be hundreds of villagers searching for this elusive fungi and no one ever
stated whether they found any, for the fear of getting robbed. The fungi, he said
would fetch someone up to a thousand rupees for a gram. And as far as he understood
it, the thing traded hands until it crossed over to China in a blooming and
illegal trade. I had learnt yet another thing that day.</p>
<p>After lunch, it was a descent to Kuari Pass, which we reached fairly easily,
considering all the hard work we had put forth till now. All of us relaxed and spent a few
minutes soaking in the scenery. The sun was still bright and we were lucky
to have a clear view. We saw that in the valley further down the trail existed, inviting
us ahead. For us, this was the point we would turn back and retrace all the way to the
campsite. I had assumed and also accepted the fact that the return journey would be
via the same path, which meant nothing new to look forward to. But Dinesh, he had other
ideas. Wanting to introduce some excitement along the way; he led us till the point where
we reached the valley of snow and instead of taking the route we used to climb here, he took us to another
point, a high ridge, from where he said we could just slide down. I initially thought
he was just joking. But before we could say anything, he was
sprinting ahead of us, with the excitement of a small child. This short-cut, although
sounding risky at first, enticed me. My spontaneous self threw caution to wind
and signed up to free-board (no boards harmed or involved) down a steep slope of snow;
something that I had never tried before in my life.</p>

<p>The first to go was Dinesh himself, creating a rough path.
He landed perfectly, using his legs to slow down towards the end before stopping. I
watched carefully and tried to make mental notes; Birender was behind me, giving instructions
and last minute tips. He did not sound very pleased at this sudden change of plans.
R was the next to go and he too did not seem to face any trouble. This gave me
a lot of confidence, and I quickly followed the same trajectory and luckily landed safely
without any problems. The whole experience lasted a few seconds, but it was enjoyable,
like a roller coaster ride. I had not given much thought to what would happen
if for some reason I could not break the flow and would just go straight into the
valley below. After me, it was G&rsquo;s turn. He started off rather clumsily and by now
the ice had hardened a little and slid faster. His weight coupled with this hardening
accelerated his slide and he abruptly spun midway, now coming down, to our utter shock,
in full speed with his back facing down, with no way to use his legs to slow his fall.
Luckily, we managed to stop his fall and rescued him from his accidental fall deeper into
the valley. He was visibly shaken by this experience. Birender, after seeing all this,
decided not to slide and walked down through an alternative route.</p>
<p>The whole valley to ourselves, without any other trekker in sight, we took our time to
enjoy the sunny day, the glistening snow under our boots and the small violet flowers that
grew among the green patches. The descent was easier on my lungs, so I was walking faster.
However, my knees took most of the impact. It was slippery in certain places, but overall,
due to the exhilaration of a completed trek and the general good weather we were blessed
with, the walk became enjoyable and relaxed. After a point, when Dinesh was certain that
we would find our way back, he asked us to walk at our own pace and reach the campsite at
leisure, which I felt was a great offer, since we were in no specific hurry to return. And
we didn&rsquo;t want to slow them down. Within the next five minutes, I saw two tiny heads disappear
beyond the next meadow, merge with the landscape against the gigantic mountains and finally
become indistinguishable to my eyes. It was getting closer to lunchtime and I could already
hear my stomach rumble thinking about the tasty meal that awaited us at the camp.</p>

<p>The beautiful weather that we had during the day was replaced abruptly with overcast skies
and terrible cold winds accompanied by rain. During our dinner, we had to take a call whether
to summit Pangarchulla the next morning or not. We decided to give it a day&rsquo;s break and
attempt it after a day. Apart from the fact that we were thoroughly tired from the long
walk, we wanted to gauge the weather that seemed to alternate between sunny and overcast,
giving us the hope that the next day would be cloudy, followed by a clear summit day. At least,
so far, as I had observed, this was the pattern. But nothing in the mountains are predictable.
The next morning turned out to be one of the clearest days in the entire trek. We spent the
day with photography and lazing around on the heated rocks. We were all visibly tired and
could not have attempted Pangarchulla that day. Now, looking back, in the cozy confines of
my bed, as I type this, in tropical climate, I would argue that had we pushed ourselves a little,
we might have had a comfortable, clear ascent to the summit. However, that was not what my
instincts told me at the camp.</p>

<p>The next morning, having got a good
practice of the drill, we promptly got ready and started walking with our headlamps at
3:30am. Having successfully completed Kuari Pass, and thus 50% of our trek, we felt confident about the
day&rsquo;s plans and hopefully summit before 12pm. We had given ourselves this deadline
based on Dinesh&rsquo;s past experiences of successful summits. The weather had been overall chilly
the previous night and it had not rained
much. But I had my own observation that good rains the previous nights
always meant clearer days subsequently; so I felt that since it did not rain much at night,
the day would not be as clear as we would have liked it to be.</p>
<p>As we went through initial routine, this time more easily over the drudgery section, over large boulders and
slippery rocks, we reached the sunrise point in good time, beating our own previous timing
by a good 45 minutes. But what we saw was not promising; the Sun, concealed by dense clouds,
although risen, was barely visible. But hoping that the weather might improve as the day
progresses, we trekked further, over the huge grasslands, the river basin and began climbing
the mountain slopes to the right. We encountered a light drizzle that progressed into a light snow fall
by the time we reached the steep ridge. I walked on the ridge with very low visibility,
completely losing the person walking right ahead of me into the mist. This not just slowed
me down, but sank my hopes too. By then, I had almost known that we might not
be able to get the view that we had dreamed of at the Summit. Yet, keeping my optimism
going, and led by Dinesh&rsquo;s encouraging words, I kept the pace.</p>

<p>By the time we climbed the steep mountain that was the crossover to the snow plains, I
realized that this day would be very different from our Kuari Pass trek, just two days ago.
What might have been an easy-moderate trek started to look difficult; and very challenging.
Walking on the snow with almost zero visibility, with no breathtaking views for encouragement,
we tried hard to keep up our spirits and not get demotivated. At a distance, when for sometime
the mist cleared, I saw another group that was at least half an hour ahead of us. It looked
like they would be attempting the summit, despite the rough weather. Our guide was apprehensive
of their decision and felt it was a risky idea. I couldn&rsquo;t agree more. I was
thankful to be part of a group that put safety first over success of summit-ting. Also, we
had an unsaid agreement of &lsquo;all or none&rsquo;, which meant we would never split the group and
would attempt only if everyone would be comfortable. These are times when trekking with
people we know and trust really made the difference.</p>
<p>By the time we had walked over the snow covered valley and traversed the path where we
had skid the previous time, we reached a point from where we could faintly see the ridge
of Pangarchulla peak. By this time, a black dog had appeared out of nowhere and had
inducted itself as a part of our trekking group. Standing there, at around 11:30am, we had to
take a call whether to push further or turn back. We completely entrusted this decision to
our guide. His face assumed a grave expression; he went silent, lost in deep thought.
His eyes were following the tiny black dots on the ridge; the advance party that had
preceded us to the summit. From a distance, it looked like a couple of people were
stranded at the bottom of the steep ridge, while some more were inching ahead, moving
very slowly, almost getting lost into the mist. Dinesh explained to us that it was a
very risky walk and the ridge was quite narrow. A small mistake would take them crashing
down the steep slope. It did look quite scary. So we took the only logical decision that
was possible at that time; to turn back. However, Dinesh and Birender guessed that the
other group might need some help, as he gauged that the two people left stranded at the
bottom of the ridge might be sick. From this distance, they seemed disoriented and suffering
from AMS, which was probably the reason why they were left there. But he was furious that
their guide prioritized the rest of the group and chose to lead them to the summit rather
than stay with the sick and take them back to safety. So he wanted us to wait while he
and Birender would go speak to them.</p>

<p>While we waited, we took pictures of ourselves, with almost nothing in the background
except mist. What lightened our moods was a second dog that had joined our group, probably
returning from the summit. I was amazed at its agility and how it easily stepped on the
snow without worrying. It might have summit-ted Pangarchulla several times during this
season already, almost treating it like a regular morning walk. The two dogs started
playing around, chasing each other in the snow. Dinesh returned and was visibly furious,
having confirmed his theory on the trekking group. He told us that the guide had deserted
them and gone ahead. However, we could see that the group was not successful in its
attempt to summit and had returned after waiting on the ridge for a few minutes and giving
up.</p>
<p>We began our return journey, with a heavy heart. It felt like it was so near yet so
far. That feeling of having almost reached there, with the destination visible and clearly
within reach, having cheated by the weather that did not co-operate. But then, this is exactly
why I love the mountains, because they ultimately decide who should summit and who shouldn&rsquo;t. AMS, weather,
all these might be excuses but the best of the best cannot proceed if the mountain doesn&rsquo;t
wish to receive them. Whether we would have summit-ted or not, had we pushed on and taken
the risk, we do not know. However, what we know for sure is that, there was zero visibility
at the top. We would have never got the magnificent view that we had come for. So a mere
successful ascent to the top would not have been satisfying to us without the views. We had to
respect the mountain for its decision and return. Probably, some other day, we might come
back when Pangarchulla calls us again.</p>
