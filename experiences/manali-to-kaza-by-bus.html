					<p>Everything looks brown here, the roads, the walls, the houses and of course the surrounding mountains, that never fail to establish their mammoth presence, constantly. It soon became my favorite past time to see the miniature buses, trucks, motorbikes moving like tiny insects along the narrow lines drawn along these huge mountains, pitting bigger and bigger vehicles against these huge rocks and then ridiculing their minuscule presence. The mountains silently reminded me of the fragility of our existence, the unsaid whispers through which they conveyed how they had seen life come and go, in an instant, in their time-lines.</p>
<p>When we sat in the front seats of an early morning bus from Manali to Kaza, little did I know that this 300 Rs ride would give us an experience that would stay with us and haunt us long after the journey itself ended. We settled ourselves and our belongings in the small two-seater bench seat of the bus, with our larger bag wedged between the engine and the gear box, our smaller backpack under our seat. The bus soon got filled with locals, all of whom looked like they were going all the way. There were a couple of Lamas also who were traveling with us. The young driver and conductor kept me entertained with their animated discussion, in Punjabi. I felt privileged sitting right at front, eager to soak up everything that the road offered.</p>
<p>We had expected this journey to be similar to the one we had undertaken to Keylong a few years ago, in a similar bus. The initial couple of hours we would be on the same route. I sat reliving my memories, bringing out the older pieces, cherishing them, polishing them and reinforcing the knowledge with updates from our current journey. Somewhere down the line, after several years, I am sure that these old and older memories would merge, giving me a feeling that it was probably a single journey. For now, I started noticing the minor differences in the landscapes. The mountains surrounding the Rohtang pass were lesser snow-covered, greener and the road seemed smoother. With a quick stop for breakfast at Marhi, we continued till Gramphoo, where I expected a fork in the road. At Gramphoo, the bus stopped briefly, almost took a u-turn, into a seemingly non-existent mud pathway. My heart started beating faster, in anticipation of a new adventure. As soon as we got into this road, I realized that it would not be as smooth as the one I had got used to so far. I still expected we would reach Kaza by four pm.</p>
<p>As the bus screeched and rattled, trying to stay on the road, I could see mud covered vehicles coming from the opposite direction. We soon ran into a traffic jam, which later I realized, was because the road was getting laid as we drove. I could see people from the vehicles had got down, collected stones from nearby and laid them on the road in order to create a pathway. For a second, I wondered if this was only an anomaly or would we encounter this often? The driver and conductor got down and helped in this process. Later the driver got in, as the conductor directed him towards the narrow pathway so the tires would not slip away. I watched as a couple of bikers tried hard to maintain balance and not skid away. As were were navigating this treacherous stretch, a group of horses started running in front of our bus. It looked almost like we were riding a horse drawn carriage! They would not give up running, they tried to keep up speed, as they got tired. Finally they moved to the side and gave way. All this while, our driver was unfazed. It looked like he had seen this and more. This suddenly increased my respect for him ten fold.</p>
<p>There was more to come. The path got rougher as we drove. At some places I could not distinguish the road from the surrounding mud. It was as though we were driving in the middle of a desert, lost. The mountains only got bigger and more imposing. I could feel their size intimidate the tiny vehicle we were in. But their beauty surpassed anything that I have witnessed so far. It was raw, untouched; brutal. A feeling of morose fear looming everywhere. Without a sign of life anywhere, at times, it felt like we were the only things alive and moving in this vast landscape. It looked as though, anytime now, the mountains can crumble and cover us with rubble. Nobody would even know that a bus was buried under the rubble. It would probably be only a tiny shift of weight for the mountains. It was a constant fight between the mountains and the gritty men who had struggled to carve out the road and maintain it - the BRO (Border Road Organization), with their land-movers constantly clearing landslides only to find the mountains coming stronger each time and covering the tracks. The roads themselves were never permanent. Routes could change anytime, based on this constant tug of war. The mountains kept winning with their might, the BRO kept catching up with it, with perseverance.</p>
<p>It was a painfully long, single stretch of road. No diversions. No distractions, no villages on the way. If we embarked on this, we had to complete it in one stretch before sundown. There were no breaks either. The driver kept on going, with complete concentration, even as most of us slept. Each time I woke up, wondering if I missed something, the landscape would remain unchanged. Even though I was sure we were moving ahead, it felt as though we were going nowhere, stuck in some time warp. Huge heaps of mud everywhere, like a vast, mega scale construction site which had dug up earth and heaped it in piles. Soon, our bus passed through beautiful mountain passes. The river kept us company, always flowing along, silently. I had thought I had seen the Himalayas enough, but each time, they offered me surprises and made me humbled. This terrain nothing like I had experienced in the Himalayas so far. I started to get accustomed to this landscape, which would be our abode for the next few days.</p>
<p>As lunchtime was nearing, I was anxious whether there would be any place to eat in this deserted place. Luckily for us, like an oasis, I spotted a tiny building far away that gave me some hope of getting food. It was an interesting place called Chacha Chachi Dhabha, which was probably setup only to serve such wayfarers like us. We were treated to generous serving of hot and tasty Rice Dhal. There were other travelers too who were enjoying this hearty meal. A couple of local women who sat next to me ordered a bowl of Maggi noodles, an usual here, as I later came to know. The Dhabha had colorful curtains inside, giving it a welcoming feel. There was also a rest room (not a toilet, but a room with beds to rest) which probably served as an overnight staying place too, in case of contingencies. The Chacha and Chachi were a fiesty couple, making jokes, speaking to everyone with affection and enjoying their role as providers. Chachi even had a small store outside the Dhabha selling knitted woolen gloves, socks, shawls, which she worked on in her free time. After this welcome break, we took our respective positions in the bus to resume our journey. The next stop I was eagerly looking forward to, was the Kunzum pass.</p>
<p>The Kunzum pass was a high altitude pass on this route, taking us all the way up to 4,500 meters, the highest we would reach on our trip in the Spiti valley. As the bus started its ascent, steadily, I could feel my head throbbing, my body fatigued by the lowering oxygen. Although by now the sun was bright and the temperatures comfortable, this ascent made me extremely tired and lethargic. As the bus reached the highest point, where it circled the Stupa and stopped for a break, I got down to experience the stillness and the magic of this beautiful spot. The white, red and orange colors of the Stupa and the colorful prayer flags against the clear blue sky and the earthy mountains lifted my spirits and made me pray. The driver who attributed his every successful trip to the Kunzum Matha, said that all he could do was drive; whether he lived another day or not was not in his hands and was only a blessing from her. He pointed in the direction of the shrine of Kunzum Matha, which was a combination of Buddhist and Hindu beliefs. I stood there experiencing the inexplicable silence among these mountains, broken only by the fluttering of prayer flags.</p>
<p>There was a deviation at this point towards Chandra Tal, which is a beautiful high altitude lake in this region. I would miss visiting this as it was not in the designated bus route. From this point, the rest of the road trip is a bit muddled in my head as symptoms of AMS had struck me and I was unaware of the changing landscape. The winds had also started blowing by now and the atmosphere had become colder. We stopped at Losar for some tea. By now, the tiredness of the driver was starting to show, he needed his breaks and more importantly, he wanted to make up for the time lost and reach Kaza before sun down. He was even more determined to drive through, unaffected by the AMS or the weather. The terrain did not show any kindness. We moved through some of the most beautiful canyons, with the light and shadow playing on the vast landscape. Even now, I shudder at the thought of the size of these mountains. The thought of driving on a dirt track, with no semblance of a road. Driving through these mega, out of the world structures was exhilarating as well as intimidating. The people who chose to brave this on bikes were truly at the mercy of the elements. The rising dust made it difficult to even breathe, let alone drive. I took comfort in the confines of our bus, which had become dear to us me now.</p>
<p>Kaza is a relatively bigger town, compared to the smaller villages that are scattered among the mountains in the Spiti Valley. I saw it as a busy area, densely populated with houses with green rooftops from the bus as we approached it. For someone who had traveled the last five hours, without seeing even a small village, through mud colored mountains and dust laden tracks, the colors that I witnessed was a welcome change, raising my anticipation of finding rest at the end of an arduous journey. As we came closer, I realized that it was not the sleepy village I had expected it to be. We were welcomed by numerous home stay boards, lodges, offering rooms, meals and even wi-fi. The bus drove right into the market area, busy with shops, people walking on the streets that were well lit.</p>
<p>Tired from the overwhelming bus ride, my only aim was now to find a cozy room, some warm dinner and rest. We soon found an accommodation that was reasonable, offered a basic but clean room and warm rugs. For now, this is all I looked forward to. The rest of the exploring can wait till the next day.</p>
