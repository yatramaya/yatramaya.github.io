					<p>Most of the tourists who land at the Calama Airport in Northern Chile have but
one purpose which is to book a direct taxi to their real destination, San Pedro
de Atacama, the jewel of the Atacama desert, a picturesque town that is tailored
around tourism. Calama, on the other hand is a mining town visited by workers -
both short and long term - and people who have some business connected to mining.
The city seems flat with mud coloured houses, shops, narrow streets, workshops
and the necessary infrastructure to maintain the families of the migrant workers.
But Calama had something that we certainly needed; a Bolivian Consulate, the
only one apart from the one at Santiago, the capital of Chile. Tucked not very
far away from its busy streets and market, we were planning to try our luck
there in obtaining a Bolivian Visa a priori which would help us when we eventually
crossed over from Chile to Bolivia. When we arrived in Calama it was already the
end of the working day, so first we needed a place to rest. Due to very low
recreational tourism, good places were hard to find but we did manage to find a
decent hostel with a kitchen. A kitchen was a priority because without any
reliable vegetarian food available around us, we were keen to cook for ourselves.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t expect though was how refreshingly simple and pleasant Calama was.
I immediately fell in love with the narrow streets with their graffiti coated
walls, the multitudes of small shops, the fresh vegetables-and-fruits and most
importantly the complete freedom of not being seen as a &ldquo;tourist&rdquo;. Apart from
the &ldquo;any-town&rdquo; status of Calama what helped was our Indian features including our
black hair. If not from Chile itself, we were quite often mistaken to be South
Americans; somewhere from the same continent. This often led to hilarious
exchanges when someone would rapid-fire me with questions or greetings in the
street in Spanish and to avoid being rude upfront, my reaction would be to
smile, nod my head or all at the same time for hopelessly too long and then at
the end of which I would eventually come to the point when in my broken Spanish
I&rsquo;d said something close to &ldquo;&ldquo;lo siento, no hablo Espagnol&rdquo;, which by the way was
the first thing I learnt to say in that language. But with all the Spanish I
could not speak, I did manage to shop for some groceries, vegetables and even
source some pre-mixed pisco sour to put together a good dinner for ourselves at the
hostel.</p>
<p>The next day we decided to walk to the Consulate, about twenty minutes away from
our hostel. It was a small building and curiously enough, it felt as if we were
entering someone&rsquo;s house via the garage-door; there wasn&rsquo;t much of a facade to
talk about. Inside, there were five people already waiting. We added ourselves to
that list of hopefuls. When a friendly staff politely approached us and inquired
about our visit, in broken Spanish but convincingly enough we replied that we
wanted to apply for Bolivian Visas. He seemed to understand, as quite understandably
it was one of their main functions. It was the queuing up that he was actually
amused about. I understood that we had missed a few essential steps. He showed
us some sample forms and indicated that we should fill it. As he spoke I registered
the words &ldquo;necessita&rdquo; &ldquo;applicacion&rdquo; &ldquo;documento&rdquo; but also realized that the form
was not a physical one but an online registration. He was kind enough to give us
the details of the website and we promised him we would be back after completing
these tasks. I was extremely grateful that he did not wait for us to get to our
turn to tell us this. We rushed back to our hostel and started the process of
filling in the form, attaching the necessary documents and photos to obtain a
printable document with all our details pre-filled in. All we needed now were
printouts of all this and we should be set. We looked for a cyber-centre nearby
with some help from our friendly hostel staff with whom I had by now, managed to
share a reliable grammar, if not a language. Feeling empowered that we were
now armed with the all the paperwork we walked into the Consulate yet again,
this time with new-found confidence, trading smiles with the now familiar official
who had spoken to us the first time. We were asked to wait for our turn.</p>
<p>I had expected this would be a quick process once the form was submitted but it
was apparent things were not smooth as yet. The official who was excited to help us
initially, asking us about our purpose of visit to Bolivia, duration and such,
soon retreated to a corner and was lost on his computer. I noticed his face
developed a worried expression as he stared at the screen. A few minutes ago he
was accommodating enough to even accept the payment in cash because we happened
to look lost when originally instructed to make the payment at a specific bank.
I wondered if he was going to come back with yet another task that would send
us on the errands around Calama. He then consulted his colleague seated beside
him, who in turn started browsing the Internet for something. I was puzzled.
With all the details already filled in, what could it be that he was looking for?
He called us closer but only for all of us to nod at each other because both
parties had emptied their baskets of simple words and phrases. This was something
that was beyond street language is what I gathered. He turned his computer
screen so that we could see it and started searching for Visa rules for Indian
Passport holders. This made me extremely insecure, as the last thing I had
expected was to have any problems with the criteria for visa. We waited like
that for a few minutes, with nothing happening in particular, looking at the
queue getting shorter and the clock threateningly inching closer to their closing
time.</p>
<p>At some point our patience was rewarded and I could stop imagining the worst when
he smiled as if struck by an epiphany and pulled out his phone. He had the
translation app too. The app did not do a great job of translating but it achieved
the bare minimum of conveying to us the good news after which all of us were
broadly smiling. As it turned out, it wasn&rsquo;t the visa criteria or even ourselves
that were problem. It was the visa fee. They were just not clear about how much
to charge for Indians. They started looking through their files for archived
forms and  informed us that were the first Indians to walk into this
particular Consulate for a Visa. So they did not have any references too. While
I stood there a little amused and with a tinge of self-importance, he returned
to us the dollars we had paid earlier. The verdict was that we did not have to
pay anything. The Bolivian Visa was free for us if we obtained it at a Consulate.</p>
<p>They day couldn&rsquo;t have gotten better but it did. Just then, the Consular General
walked into the room, a gentleman who was dressed to look prim and proper and
most importantly serious. He spoke to them concisely and purposefully. He then
looked at us and spoke to us in English, asking us about our travel. He then
told us not to worry and that our visa will be ready in just a few minutes. I was
thrilled and thanked him profusely. I told him what a pleasant experience it was
visiting the Consulate and how grateful we were for all the help from the friendly
officials. He told us that he was a native of La Paz, the capital of Bolivia and
told us what a beautiful country Bolivia was. I was now extra-eager to find out
for myself, having got a taste of Bolivian hospitality at the Consulate itself,
instilling confidence that our decision to visit this small, often ignored,
country in South America was going to be very exciting, after all.</p>
