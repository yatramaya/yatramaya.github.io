					<p>If you would find yourself stuck in a time loop, where you find yourself waking up in the same place each day for the rest of your life, where would you like it to be? When I ask myself this question, one of the places that came to my mind was Cartagena. This coastal city of Northern Colombia is one of those places that offers many experiences at the same time. It is very Colombian, yet very different from the rest of Colombia. The Caribbean Sea is of course your constant companion, never too away, offering drama, excitement, peace, solitude, depending on what you seek at the time. There is the &ldquo;Boca Grande&rdquo; with its posh hotels, swanky buildings competing for sea facing space. The &ldquo;Centro&rdquo; or the old fort that houses a whole different world where you can lose yourself soaking up culture and experiencing the colonial era. The &ldquo;Getsemani&rdquo; bordering the Centro with its hippy culture and budget homestays, where you can meet the non-touristy locals leading their regular lives and get to become a part of the proceedings on this quaint little town. Wherever you walk, you are sure to be greeted by smiling faces, colourful graffiti, sculptures and art installations and some excellent Colombian food accompanied by Cerveza (beer). Standing in front of a graffiti of the famous writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez, lovingly called &lsquo;Gabo&rsquo;, some unforgettable scenes from a thousand years of solitude came to my mind.</p>
<p>Exploring the Centro in the morning gave us some quiet time walking along the edge of the fort wall. We reached a higher point that offered spectacular view of the Caribbean Sea. A large gate with a clock tower (known to the locals as Boca del Puente or commonly known to tourists as Puerta del Reloj)separates the Centro from the surrounding Getsemani. Entering thus, and walking along the cobblestone streets, the Old Town looks pretty with its colourful colonial buildings with their bougainvillea creepers. I could observe a few seagulls fishing in the waters. A long walk along the peripheries of the fort can be tiring yet gives a good idea of the place. Walking into a breakfast place, which was probably the only one that was open serving coffee and shakes with scrambled eggs, toast, pancake and spreads, I could sense that this place should come alive by night. We walked past a Cathedral with large doors and beautiful frescos. The square was populated with Caribbean locals selling a few small curios. There were beautifully dressed women in their colourful traditional clothes with fruit baskets on their heads known as Palenqueras. Most of them will also be pleased to pose for a photograph, for a small tip. These Caribbean Africans are a reminder of the terrible colonial past when their ancestors were brought in as slaves through the port of Cartagena, from where the Spanish conquistadors also shipped the treasures they had pillaged from the natives back to Spain.</p>

<p>The small restaurants had put out their tables and music blasted from one of the restaurants. There was excitement in the air. Elderly gentlemen walked with their walking sticks and sombreros, people took their positions at the tables sipping their beers and mobile snack stalls appeared at regular intervals. The plaza was filling up with spectators in anticipation of what would unfold on the makeshift stage. It was around 5pm; we walked through the crowd and took one of the tables facing the centre stage at the Trinidad Square of Getsemani. A few young men had started displaying their talent - freestyle dancing. This was an open-air party in the backstreets of Getsemani. Everyone was invited; there were no tickets, no schedules, yet everyone coming there knew that they would have a good time. We moved on towards the Centro. The shops and restaurants were getting ready to receive their customers and invite them to experience their goodies on offer. An Arepa restaurant serving a wide range of vegetarian stuffed Arepas was our next stop. A common snack in Colombia, Arepas soon became one of my favourites, either plain or stuffed and I was always on the lookout for restaurants that would cater to my palate restrictions. Black beans, avocados, cheese, stir fried vegetables with delectable sauces made my Arepa exciting. Another item I treated myself to often, were Patacones (sometimes known as Toastones).</p>

<p>The area en-route from Getsemani to the fort was busy with locals crowding around small roadside stalls selling snacks and beverages. There were Chiva buses parked in a line with ushers calling tourists to take a ride in these refurbished open top buses to get a city tour of Cartagena. There were regular buses and trams too alongside these vintages for locals to commute. There were street carts enticing us with &ldquo;Hugo Naturales&rdquo; offering freshly squeezed fruit juices with no added water or sugar. As we entered the fort, the ambience turned from city scenes back in time to the colonial era. The fort area enclosed some of the prime properties of hotels, restaurants and shops. This was the most touristy part of Cartagena. The bright, colourful daytime slowly picks up tempo as the sun sets and the party begins. It is an all-night party each night in the Centro, with the streets coming to life under the neon lights. The streets were decorated with various themes - we walked through a street which had hundreds of flags from all over the world overhead, it was a beautiful installation with multicoloured flags and serial lights filling the sky as we walked underneath this blanket of nations. Another street was filled with colourful umbrellas, hundreds of them above us like balloons; and we walked through a street that had colourful balloons of all sizes.</p>
<p>Each street was lit up brilliantly and the restaurants decked up boasting of cuisines from all across the world. A Pakistani restaurant run by a Punjabi who was dressed in traditional costume spoke to us in Urdu, mistaking us to be Pakistanis, invited us proudly to his restaurant. It mattered little to him that we were from India, he did not see much of a difference between the two countries and I must admit, being so far away from home, neither did I. We gave him a broad smile and a generous nod and walked on. The night had just begun and we were not yet ready to settle for a sitting dinner. Horse drawn carriages ferrying tourists crossed our paths every few minutes. They added a special charm to the colonial structures and the overall ambience of the place. There were women with open stalls with neatly arranged local dried fruits, spices, jams, pickles, colourful candies, toffees of all shapes, fryums and several goodies that were fresh and fast selling. We tried some fresh sweet made of coconut and pina (pineapple).</p>

<p>Our next stop was a famous ice cream parlour that boasted of the best ice cream, not just in Cartagena, but in all of Colombia. The shop was overflowing with enthusiastic children and adults alike who thronged the place to get a scoop of their favourite flavour of ice cream. As we walked out with our prized possession of the best ice cream, one each of blueberry and selva flavour, we reached the central square, which had a statue named &ldquo;Monumento a Don Pedro De Heredia&rdquo;. It was surrounded by colonial styled buildings on all sides, enclosing a large square with some artists offering to paint a picture of you, small mobile stalls selling antiques and memorabilia. We decided to walk into a Juan Valdez coffee shop for some excellent coffee. The area had many pubs, cafes, restaurants with outdoor tables serving local as well as international cuisines. Having to choose just one of out of the hundreds of eating places was unfair, yet we settled for one of the busiest bars &ldquo;El Baron&rdquo; enjoying some of the best gourmet food and cocktails. One was called Puro and had a smoked tobacco flavour, made with whisky and decorated with chilli and salt on the rim. Another was a cocktail of Tequila, ginger, lemon, accompanied by tapas food of roasted potato with Aji cream, Aji powder. Sitting on one of the benches under the neon lights, experiencing the beautiful surroundings I anticipated the walk back to my room. But first, some rest for my legs.</p>
