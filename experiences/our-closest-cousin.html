					<p>It was unmistakably the most beautiful place we would be staying in our entire trip. I could spend hours just looking at the mountains, and the rainforests and never cease to be amazed by their existence, being drawn into them further and further with every passing moment. I could be lost momentarily in mundane tasks like eating or washing clothes or fussing about the ants but the presence of the mountains constantly pulls me into a trance every now and then. I just sit and stare at them, for several minutes at a stretch. The tall, slender trees with their canopies extending towards the sky, the green and the brown colours that become distinct as the sun shines at them, briefly, between the spells of heavy rain. It is not for no reason that they are called rain forests. When it does rain, it pours and completely covers my view of the trees. The longer I gaze at them I keep discovering additional layers, ranges that extend as far as my eyes can see; always covered in mist. The clouds move amongst those ranges; white fluffy tufts floating around. There is always a feeling that it is about to rain any moment.</p>
<p>These mysterious mountains are the last refuge to the very few remaining mountain gorillas in the world. The gorillas that have adapted to survive in these rain forests have failed to survive anywhere else in the world making this piece of forest the most precious habitat. Each time I look at these misty mountains, I can only pray that they remain as they are, impenetrable to humans.</p>

						View of Bwindi Impenetrable Forest from CTPH

<p>The first thing that drew me to these mountains was when I heard about their name, “Bwindi Impenetrable Forest”. Impenetrable, the word itself is enchanting, formidable. I thought, what would it take to “penetrate” them? How would it feel? Would the forest allow me to pass through? Could I share a few minutes with the mammoth trees and the majestic inhabitants? The name was motivation enough for planning a trip there, although knowing very well that it would be a long, arduous, stressful journey to reach this remote corner of western Uganda. These forests border the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) which is the heart of African continent, the greenest part of the globe when seen on the satellite map; a whole country seemingly covered by rain forests and hosting innumerable species of plant and animal life. DRC, we could never go to, sadly. Not because of the forests, but because of the human conflict, stories of violence, kidnapping, complete breakdown of civic facilities and law-and-order problems.</p>
<p>Hence, the fact that the Congo is completely out of bounds for us became another huge factor that added to the mystique of visiting Bwindi. While driving towards Buhoma (one of the villages close to south of Bwindi forests), we chanced upon a road that would lead to the Uganda&rsquo;s border with DRC, just 10 kms away. This got my heart racing. What if I just sneaked into the country and got lost in the forests? For the animals, the country borders are non existent. They cross over freely, mostly in search of food and shelter. It is probably not a coincidence that a country rife with political upheavals and mostly closed to tourists (as well as some of the bravest explorers) is one of the richest in natural resources.</p>

<p>We were lucky to be staying in a campsite that was just a walking distance from the Bwindi forests. The camp is run by &ldquo;Conservation Through Public Health&rdquo; (CTPH), a gorilla conservation centre focused on creating the awareness and improving the overall health of the community in the surrounding villages and also rehabilitating them by finding pathways of co-existence by activities that are less likely to converge in man-animal conflict one of which happens to be the growing of coffee and its marketing. The researchers at the institute routinely went on surveys that included activities such as collecting gorilla faeces samples from the forests and examining them for deadly diseases. The camping we were provided was the bare minimum we had opted for but they did have rooms and a kitchen too if one was so inclined. They also arranged gorilla passes to trek into the forest. The friendly team of doctors, staff and volunteers to took us around the campus and explained in great detail the significance of their work and how it all ultimately rolled up into the common cause of saving the last few mountain gorillas from extinction.</p>
<p>Our tent was pitched at the edge of the forests, at the foothills of these mountains. The constant calls of various birds in our camp was the only sound that broke the silence now and then. The view from the campsite as we just sat casually and sipped coffee was out of the world. We were there only for three days, but every moment felt so eventful, so full, as if something was about to happen all the time. It was like this mega screen of life unfolding in front of me, leaving me guessing what mysteries were hidden behind their “impenetrable” canopies. The scenery did change every now and then; a slightly darker sky, an extra cloud there, an area completely masked by the mist. The cool mountain breeze grazed our extremities and left us feeling refreshed. Sometimes the clouds made their presence felt physically as they caressed over the mountains on which our tent was pitched.</p>

<p>We walked through the tea plantations surrounding the forests. Though it felt strange to be knowing something as commercial as tea was existing just outside one of the richest rainforests, we later came to know that, like coffee, it was a strategic move by the forest authority. They served the purpose of forming a buffer zone for avoiding the human-gorilla conflict. Because the gorillas did not feed on tea leaves, they did not tend to cross over to the human settlements. We were ascending the mountain along the slope covered by tea plantations. I was breathing, heaving and gasping soon due to the chill mountain air. I wanted to ascend slowly but I was impatient to cross over the tea gardens quickly into the forests.</p>
<p>The change was dramatic. The boundary was a thin line; at one moment we were in open plantations, the next moment we were into the forest. The dense canopy, the dampness of the air, the rich, rotting mulch under my feet indicated our entry into the forest. We were no longer just wandering in tea plantations. We had entered the rainforest. The path was difficult and treacherous. We walked in slush, with our shoes completely wet within minutes. We crossed numerous streams with fresh flowing water. The forest felt “alive”. It supported an entire ecosystem mostly unknown to us, waiting to be discovered. We walked along the slopes of the mountains, with no definite or marked pathways. I stepped onto a web of twigs sometimes, not knowing what was underneath. It was hard to even leave footprints behind. Every step of mine, was measured, in order to be kind to the hundreds of insects in the forest floor. The slopes were slippery due to the rain, I slipped and fell often. My feet did not feel confident. And ascending the mountains in this kind of a terrain was a whole new challenge that I was unprepared for. The excitement of accidentally running into a gorilla while we were busy keeping one foot in front of the other and managing to stay upright kept me going. I looked up to see if there was any sign of sunshine; if at all any rays of light had managed to escape the dense canopy. There was hardly any. We were inside. Deeper and deeper into the rain forest, where getting lost was the easiest.</p>

<p>The trees around were not very thick, but instead, were slender and tall. But despite that, they were in plenty; a dense forest. It created a micro climate that was several degrees cooler. And then the rain, which was a constant even in the dry season. The rain forests were green and thriving with amazing bird and insect life. There was moss growing everywhere, on rocks, on twigs and on the tree barks. Whatever I touched was soft and moist. The rocks were slippery and difficult to step on. The water flowing in the streams was pristine. Rain forests have their own mechanism of creating and using the water necessary to keep them evergreen. The condensation from the forests form clouds which will pour again as rain. So the water is cycled within. The vegetation is well suited for primates and apes that inhabit these forests. The entire stretch along the equator was once covered with dense rain forests such as these. Today, one has to visit DRC to find what can be called the closest to the original rain forests. Or, one could visit the (now) degraded forests like Kakamega in Kenya.</p>

<p>The walk took us about three hours, during which I was exhausted trying to just keep myself from falling. I was thankful for the walking-stick. Although, my shoes were not doing great and I was afraid it would give way and I would have to walk barefoot in such a terrain, and that was unimaginable. A pair of gum boots would have been better suited as they would be completely water proof and knee length. I had tucked my pants inside my socks as the forest was notoriously popular for safari ants and as the guide warned us they would simply crawl up your legs and sting you when you least expect it and in places that one cannot describe or call out without embarrassing oneself. Leeches however (and thankfully) non existent due to the cold climate and the altitude.</p>

<p>The gorilla group we were trying to follow was giving us a hard time, moving between hills very quickly. The sound of various monkeys and birds pierced the silence now and then. It would have been impossible to find the gorillas on our own without the help of the forest rangers who were well versed with this terrain and could follow signs of their presence — chewed up shoots, pathways where vegetation is flattened due to their movement, fresh dung, new nests they built previous night. The gorillas look for fruiting trees, especially figs and they keep moving in search of better tasting fruits. They mostly eat leaves but in fruiting season, they develop a preference for fruits to supplement their leaf diet. Occasionally they also feed on insects, snails and other creepy crawlies they can find on the forest floor. Every once in a while we would apparently come across the aforementioned signs and the rangers would have a quick group discussion and then positively and purposefully take choose one among the faint trails that were visible ahead. And off we went.</p>

<p>In the half an hour that followed, we went up and down three more hills, crossed many a small streams and eventually ended up in a clearing. Then, there it was, right in front of us. Black, huge and hairy. The animal looked like it was a large tank that was rolling towards us. It was hard to believe that I would be looking at a Gorilla at such close range. I got goosebumps to see a close relative. I had read that humans share 98% of genetic material with them; simply remarkable. I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking that I had run into one and was staring into the eyes of a long lost family member whom I had discovered again. The feeling, when the creature looked at me straight in the eye, was unforgettable. I felt a deep sense of belonging; something stronger than what I had ever felt until then for any human being I have not known closely.</p>
<p>Introductions were not needed. Nor were there, any awkward moments. I felt completely comfortable in their company and they took it quite well too. Their size was a bit intimidating. These are huge, powerful animals and it is wise to leave them alone and keep a distance. I singled out one of them for closer observation. It was the male; the alpha. I stared at him, the rugged palms with nails, the large nostrils, the curved mouth which extended. And, the eyes which were deep, brown and so expressive. The expressions of the face, the gestures, the body postures, everything so similar to humans. The similarity is unmistakable.</p>

<p>I could just sit there and stare at them for hours. The family consisted of the said silverback, two females, two toddlers and two juveniles. The silverback, named Kanyonyi, who was about 38 years of age was the head of the family and he made his presence felt. He was large with a huge head, hefty arms and legs. He grunted, farted and just lazed around, constantly watching over his family. The toddlers, just a few months old, were playing with their mums or jumping on their dad’s back. It was amusing to watch them climb slender plants and try to take support and get surprised when the poor plant would give way and break due to their weight. And they would try this all over again.</p>
<p>The mother of the family was lying down on her side, crossing her leg, keeping her head slightly lifted and supported by one arm and looking at me, watchfully I presumed. Yet, when she stared at me I could sense that she did not feel threatened or excited. She was calm. The younger ones at some point got naughty and started coming closer to us. We stepped back with every movement. But they just playfully tried to snatch the small stick that the ranger was carrying.</p>

<p>Time passed ever so quickly. I did not realise that it was already an hour. I was spellbound by this unique rendezvous. For those minutes I sat there with them, I was completely detached from reality. I did not think of anything. Just sat there and observed them. Nothing else in this world seemed to bother me at that point of time. My mind was cleared of thoughts that had haunted me so far — about the fragility of this delicate ecosystem, that there were less than a thousand of them left, that their species is threatened by human activities like poaching, destruction of rainforests and spread of diseases. I was only feeling a sense of belonging. I became one among them, lost in the simplicity of existence.</p>
