					<p>It was exactly how I had imagined it; perhaps better than that, because I remember
sitting on that boat spellbound and self-aware that I had gone very quiet. The
boat was navigating through the Maranon river in whose waters reflected the
rising sun. The reflection moved ahead as we did ever so slowly, unhurried by
the seeming speed that was implied by the engine itself which was the only thing
I can remember as noise. Since it was daybreak, most people on the boat were
still a bit sleepy despite the early morning bus-ride that got us to Nauta where
we all boarded into a motorboat.</p>
<p>In about twenty minutes or so the sun had drifted as far as it would for this
journey of ours. It had now painted the entire body of water ahead of us in
a glowing orange, mimicking the real thing that was slowly rising up into the
sky. The canvas on which this orange was painted was the meeting place of the
Maranon and the Ucayali rivers. Our boat was making a turn now. From going with
the flow, to against it. From downstream to upstream. The marriage of the two
very wide rivers wasn&rsquo;t like any other. I had a strange feeling of being held
responsible for something. In this case, for the birth of one of the world&rsquo;s
longest rivers. We were making this large U-turn at the very place from where
the river would be called the Amazon. I had yet another strange feeling; this
time, a guilt of betrayal, or a tinge of jealousy perhaps, for some of the
canoes and boats that were headed east for the day, to follow this geographical
masterpiece to better conclusions through the settlements in Peru and then to
the large country of Brazil, finally to drain somewhere far away into the sea.</p>
<p>But that had to be for another day. On this particular day we had already headed
southbound, upstream the Ucayali. The Ucayali itself is a long river, its head
waters somewhere in the South of Peru and traversing almost the entire country to
meet the Maranon in the North. The boat slowed down almost instantaneously and
the stress on the engine was felt via its hoarse cry. For the next few hours
it would be like that, against all that water that was incessantly flowing in
the other direction. The sun was now illuminating the backs of our heads. While
Nauta was a blur - due to the fact that I was just getting used to the morning,
combined with the unavoidable anxiety of a traveller who had to switch modes of
transport - what I saw now on either side registered well. There were only a
few homes visible and most of it in very small clusters. I wasn&rsquo;t sure how
deep this clusters ran inland but from what was visible, I could see that most
homes had a canoe anchored right in front of their homes. The homes were basically
huts-on-stilts, the heights of which are testimony to the time and experience
of the people who lived there and their relationship with the river. Sometimes
I saw a man or a woman with weather-beaten faces drying a produce here or fixing
a net there. Sometimes we stared; not at each other of course, them at the moving
boat and me at their lives. It was inspiring to say the least. I was clearly
looking at the present and past at the same time. This was real and they were
people cut off from a lot of what is today the modern world, their trade route
being just this river and yet it was the past too for the human story, a past
mostly forgotten by the largesse.</p>

<p>Just then, the boat switched off. Engine trouble is what I understood when the
driver and usher decided to walk the aisle to the rear and of the boat and
open that ubiquitous room which always has NO-ENTRY written on the door and
which always makes me curious. Fume and stench filled the cabin when someone
opened it. But apparently it wasn&rsquo;t a big concern and we were moving again. I
enjoyed the break though; with the engine shut off, the boat wobbled and moved
freely in the Ucayali for a moment to take the experience into primitive realms.
A thought crossed my mind; what if I got to experience the canoes? That would
be nice, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure if that can be arranged. The momentary silence also
drew my attention to the birds that were about the water, the most interesting
being the Black Skimmer which swooped down once in a while just above the surface
of the water, positioning its lower beak under the surface and looking for something
to feed on. There were other familiar birds too; Anhingas, Herons and Ducks. All
of them on a feeding spree before the sun moved into harsher angles.</p>
<p>There was just one stop before reaching our destination. It was a largish place
the size of which I would never fully grasp but by the amount of huts I could
see and the fact that it merited a jetty.
The boat moved in close and a few more people boarded. The time was about 11
in the morning and we were expected to be at Requina where our contact Jose
would be waiting for us. It would be overly complicated to find Jose among a
whole lot of people. But that wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem because there were only two
of us foreigners today on the boat which meant that we only had to stay put at
the Jetty after getting off; he would find us. The river shrunk in width after
our first stop but it was nevertheless very deep right at the centre. The sky
that was dominating the landscape up until then was slowly giving way to taller
and taller vegetation on the banks; a clear indication that as we progressed
we could expect lesser of the clearings and more of the jungle. I sat in
anticipation as the boat turned another corner and far ahead I saw yet another
settlement, this time composed of a lot more buildings, roads and permanent
structures; Requina, where another episode of our journey was to begin.</p>
