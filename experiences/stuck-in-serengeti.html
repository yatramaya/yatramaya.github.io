					<p>At this point, I knew we were not getting anywhere. We were in the middle of wilderness with a vehicle that refused to move and nobody in sight for miles to even ask for assistance. As the driver got out of the vehicle to collect more logs, I was thinking about the lions we just saw and how they might have sensed that a human being was walking around. They could be watching us from a distance and tracking our movements. Inside the vehicle we felt safe, but once we were out of it, we were defenceless. We humans do not even have the instincts to know if a predator is around. We had to wait for the vehicle to come out of this mess for us to move ahead. The driver was getting us out for a minute and getting stuck the next. We were losing time. This part of the safari was something we were not prepared for.</p>
<p>I figured it would be difficult to continue at this rate. The driver panicked and started revving up the engine. Getting stuck in this kind of mud can be very frustrating. He probably lost his patience and felt he could somehow get it out by force. The engine made loud noises and refused to move even an inch. We could smell the tyres burning under us. Soon the engine gave way. Smoke came out of the bonnet. And my heart sank. This would mean that the game drive would end here. At exactly half day.</p>

<p>Our day had started early, at the Ndabaka Serengeti Gate. Once in, we met our game driver, saw the Land Rover he had brought along, which looked right out of the Born Free movie. We were excited. The registration process was strict and thorough, after which we were inside. Even before entering the gates, we saw some wildebeests grazing, baboons foraging and several birds. Our game drive had officially begun now. The vehicle was sturdy and heavy, it went on the mud roads powerfully. We saw a lot of antelopes of various types — gazelles, imphala, toupe, dik dik, water bucks. They were mostly shy, freezing on seeing our car and fleeing as we approached them. There was a slight drizzle, which did not offer great light for photography, but it was pleasant weather for the animals. There were zebras grazing by the side of the road. We witnessed the famous “Zebra crossing”, when they sprinted across the road.</p>
<p>All along I was humming, “In the jungle the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight..” from the lion king, in my mind. I was finally witnessing the “vast endless plains of serengeti… “ a phrase that I have heard again and again and had imagined so much in my mind. And, Serengeti did not disappoint. Greenish fresh blades of grass sprouting among the yellowish older ones due to the recent rains, the plains, the hills, everything covered by a lush green carpet peppered with acacia and cacti trees and shrubs. The sun tried to pierce through the dense clouds and trying to add a golden glow to the landscape. The hills were like scoops of ice cream, smooth and green, covered with grass and with some trees. The animals could be seen like tiny specs of dust on this green carpet. They were in abundance, easy to spot because of the vast, plain landscape.</p>

<p>The birds were active too — rollers, buffalo weavers, shrikes, sparrows, hornbills, hammerkops, several types of herons, storks were seen all along. We stopped every time we spotted a colourful bird and the vehicle stopped for us till we had our fill. Vultures were perched on treetops trying to spot a kill and scavenge. We also spotted eagles, black shouldered kites and harriers trying to hunt for their food. The circle of life can be seen so clearly and beautifully here in the Serengeti. The smaller insects, reptiles, rodents that become food for the larger birds and smaller variety of animals. Then the antelopes, zebras that get hunted by the big cats and the scavengers hyenas, vultures polishing away the last remaining flesh. Nothing gets wasted here. Only bare bones and skulls were seen scattered across the landscape.</p>

<p>We then drove towards Grumeti river that was flowing in full force due to the rains. The water was muddy, washing away a lot of soil from the banks all along. A bridge across the river gave us amazing views of the surrounding tree cover and the temperature here was much cooler. The hippos were seen cooling off on the shallow parts of the river, along the banks. We spotted one shy hippo that had come out into the grass to graze and on seeing our vehicle approach, slowly walked away into the water. The nile crocodiles were lying motionless on the rocks. They had brilliant patterns of grey and yellow on their body. We also saw some baby crocodiles that had come out to bask. One large one lay in front of us, motionless, almost giving us the impression that it was a statue. And once we moved away, it got into the safety of water in swift movements. To know that these crocodiles are powerful enough to bring down wildebeests crossing the Grumeti river during the migration season makes them seem more intimidating.</p>

<p>We planned to cross the river at a point 10 kms away from where we were, but on reaching that place realised that the road was washed away and the river was flowing across it in full force. We soon gave up the plan and moved ahead. The secondary mud tracks had become soggy due to the recent rains. And Serengeti is notoriously famous for the clay-like, sticky black cotton soil that has got even the best of the drivers off guard. We noticed that our driver did not look very confident to take them on. He gingerly crossed the mud tracks, got down a couple of times to walk a short distance and check out the terrain before taking in the vehicle, because he knew that once we are in, there is no way we could get out easily. We were okay as long as we continued to see animals. Soon we spotted jackals crossing the road — a mother and two smaller cubs. The mother was protective of her cubs and slowly ushered them away from us without letting us know she was afraid. These were the black backed jackals.</p>

<p>The landscape alternated between vast plains and wooded areas. Both equally beautiful and enthralling for my senses. The mild drizzle cooled down the temperatures and we could feel the cool wind on our faces as we stood in the vehicle and looked around to spot animals and birds. In most safaris, people are eager to see the Big 5 (Lion, Leopard, Elephant, Rhino and Buffalo) and so the tour guides are also in a rush to show them these animals. And in that rush, they forget to look closely at the smaller creatures, the reptiles, the birds, mongooses that make up this ecosystem. There is life all around. Like the tortoise we spotted along the roadside. It was trying to make its way into the grass, slowly, at its own pace. What a creature!</p>

<p>Soon we spotted giraffes, three of them. They were grazing the leaves of acacia. One was darker and the other was lighter in color and the third was a little one, also darker in color. These are some of the most amazing creatures, defying all logic of anatomy and yet surviving majestically in this wilderness. They are extremely strong and can run very fast. Shy and curious, they like to stop grazing and look right into the camera as soon as we stop and point one at them. We saw one bending its knees and neck drinking water from a small watering hole. We waited for it to finish drinking and it stood up, doubled in height, and looked at us. And then, we drove on. The sun was getting the better of rain and it looked like it would finally win this race.</p>

<p>Our driver looked quite nervous and was focused on driving the vehicle, so we were left to do the spotting and identification ourselves. Only a couple of times he helped us by giving the correct name of species we did not know. Also, he would wait for us to spot the animal and when we ask him to stop and enquire about the animal, he says its name in a matter of fact way. In some cases, he would tell us its gestation period or lifespan when least expected. It was quite amusing at the beginning but was slowly getting irritating, especially since he could not understand and communicate very well in English. We tried several words and protocols for stopping the vehicle and moving ahead once we are done, but he would always get it wrong and stop too late or right in front of the animal to scare it away. And, he somehow never understood when we asked him to move ahead. We just shrugged it off and focused on the landscape and animals. We were still enjoying every bit of this experience.</p>

<p>A safari and game drive of this sort was possible only in Africa. We have travelled in some of the national parks in India, but somehow a whole day of game drive (and still have a majority of landscape uncovered) was unthinkable. It would probably be for a few hours and we would have covered most of the national park. The vastness was unmistakable. Serengeti is the size of a decent country. It consists of thousands of animals, but they are all so spread out and so difficult to see every bit of it. And for miles together, we did not spot another human being apart from the three of us. It was as though we were the only ones in the park. And I am sure every one of those vehicles scattered across the length and breadth of the park would feel the same. Although this was not peak season. We have heard of stories where people crowd near the river to witness the wildebeests crossing in large numbers.</p>

<p>The park was very organized in terms of regulating vehicles, timings of gate closing, speed limits and proper sign boards indicating which roads to take. There were several luxury tented camps inside the park that were reachable by air strips. We visited the Grumeti air strip later where we stopped for having lunch. It was a small air strip, with a little clearing in the grass and a reception and restrooms. Just before reaching this spot for lunch, we found a pride of lions relaxing under the shade of a tree. There were two adult lioness and three or four cubs. They had just feasted on a zebra kill. We could see that they had hidden the half eaten zebra under a nearby tree. We came to know that they tend to hide it under bushes of a particular type that keeps away flies and prevents the flesh from rotting fast. All the animals that I saw, put together, can never even come close to the experience of seeing a pride of lions. None of the national geographic videos I have seen so far can even come close to experiencing this in the wild and to know that only a thin glass and a vehicle separates us from these powerful animals.</p>

<p>During lunch break, our driver decided to change one of the rear tyres of the vehicle. Whether it was punctured or he felt it was not good enough, we were not sure, as he was not very communicative. We continued on our safari. Soon after, we had to cross over to the other side of the river, which seemed like an impossible task given the amount of water that was flowing ahead of us. But he decided to go for it, probably out of the new found confidence of changing tyre. We crossed the water easily and just when we were feeling victorious, we realized our driver had drove us into a slushy track and we were stuck. The more he tried to get us out, the more we got stuck, deeper and deeper. Finally he got out and took a look at the tyres. We asked him if it would help to put some stones on the track and try to go over them. He seemed to get the idea and started looking for stones. But since he couldn’t find any, he collected some twigs and branches and put them into the tracks to fill it. We helped him in this task and soon we could get the vehicle moving. But not for long. It got stuck again on the side of the road as he tried to move away from the track. The sides which looked very dry, covered with grass was equally slushy underneath. And they were deceptive. We expected that the driver would at least know about this, but he seemed to be equally surprised.</p>
<p>Our exciting game drive had taken an interesting turn at mid-day. This we had not anticipated. We tried to get some help. Our driver climbed on top of the vehicle to catch some mobile signal. By this time the sun was right above us and shining brightly. The tsetse flies started getting into the vehicle sensing human blood. I had only heard about them and their stinging bite. Now I was seeing one and trying to stay clear of them and avoid getting bitten. Then as a ray of hope we heard the sound of a vehicle approaching. We look behind and a group of four young men came in an open tourist vehicles. They were not tourists, but were staff from one of the nearby camps who had heard the engine sound and had figured someone was stuck. They wanted to come and see if they can get us out. We were relieved and thankful for their kind gesture. As they were approaching us, to my utter dismay, I saw that they drove through the same bad patch that had got us stuck earlier and now they were stuck too. So two vehicles stuck miserably in the infamous Serengeti black cotton soil!</p>
<p>While those men were now busy getting their vehicle out, our man had decided that he would pour water to cool things down. He started collecting muddy water from nearby puddles in a water bottle and filling the radiator slowly. He did several trips to achieve this. Since he wouldn’t understand, I didn’t tell him that putting muddy water instead of clean, distilled water would make things worse. We knew at this point that unless we get another vehicle (which was highly unlikely), our game drive would terminate abruptly here. Now we were more concerned about our safety and how we would resolve this issue and get back home. The guys managed to pull out their vehicle, then came running to help us out. We thanked them profusely, with a lot of “Asante Sana’s” and smiles and they were cheerful and in good spirits. But they seemed to know what they were doing and together within a few minutes, got our vehicle running and out of our misery. But it was a temporary rescue just to get the vehicle into the safety of their camp, where a mechanic would take a look at it. So we followed them to their camp. We were taken to the staff restaurant and asked to make ourselves comfortable there, among some empty metal chairs and some tables. We just sat there waiting for some directions.</p>
<p>It was a luxury camp, with the tourist tents hidden away from our view and the staff quarters, restaurant and recreation area away from the tourist areas. For the first time, we were witnessing the back alleys of these camps that we had read so much about. We were in the company and mercy of cheerful, friendly and sympathetic staff, each of whom we met offered their sympathies to us saying “pole” and assured us that we could feel at home here and relax. Unfortunately, we were not in the mood for relaxation. But once the chance of continuing the game drive vapourized, thanks to our amazing driver and his tour manager, we relaxed a bit and made conversations with some of the staff. Unlike our driver, these people knew English, they were very tourist friendly and were trained to speak politely to tourists. We could communicate with him and he patiently responded to each of our queries about the Serengeti, the routes and about the camp itself. After some time, someone came and switched on the television and everyone present got engrossed in a football match. We too watched for sometime with them, trying to share their enthusiasm for the African clubs. A couple of them were engaged in a game of pool at the pool table. Overall it was their free time when their guests were off on a game drive far away and they could relax. It was nice to see them happy and enjoying themselves.</p>
<p>Our driver appeared out of nowhere and told us that another vehicle is coming to pick us up and take us home. We felt a little better. What we didn’t know is when. As Africans are never good at estimating time, when he said 45 minutes, logically we knew we were atleast two hours away from Bunda so the least the vehicle would take was two hours. Finally it arrived after three hours and we drove in another vehicle till the bridge (the same one we had leisurely crossed in the morning) which we would have to cross by foot to reach the other side where the vehicle would be waiting for us. Since it was not a four wheel drive, it could only reach till that point. The guys in the airstrip picked us up and drove us along with a forest guard till this point. It was past park closing time and we were in a zone when driving was not really allowed. But we had to state our exception and drive in off-game driving hours.</p>

<p>The animals had probably also got used to these timings and seemed much more free. At least I felt like they were. We again passed the same pride of lions. This time, they were on the road side with the cubs playing around, seemed active as the sun was going down and the night had started to set in. Another lioness was sitting and feasting on the zebra carcass. I was breathless when she looked directly at me with blood soaked jaws. She was pulling out the liver of the animal and trying to eat it. The lion was barely a couple of metres away from our vehicle. It was one thing to see them relax under the shade of a tree. It was totally different to see them tear flesh with their powerful jaws and eat a zebra, part by part. This was something I had only seen on documentaries and witnessing this live is an unforgettable scene. The other lioness was getting agressive and irritated by our presence as she had her cubs with her. They were extremely playful and did not seem to be shy or fear our presence. Although these animals are accustomed to some vehicles, they are still very wild and their actions cannot be predicted. There have been several cases of careless tourists who have stepped out of the safety of their vehicle, only to be torn apart by lions. The power of this animal can and never should be under estimated. Afterall they are predators and we are in the middle of wilderness, in their territory, where unmistakably they rule. We stopped for a minute and watched and then left them alone to finish their meal.</p>
<p>We crossed the bridge on foot, with the company of an armed forest guard who had to ensure we are safe and not wander off. He left us once we were transferred to another vehicle. Now we were in a much smaller, lighter car that was not meant to be driven in a national park. It was meant to be a matatu and ferry passengers somewhere in villages. The driver was a regular matatu driver who had somehow got himself into this adventure that he did not ask for. He looked terrified and wanted to drive as fast as possible and somehow get us out of the park, into the safety of human habitation. For us, the adventure was far from over.</p>

<p>This was an experience we had never anticipated or signed up for. But we seemed to get it for free, nevertheless. The sun was going down and we were driving west. We witnessed an amazing sunset at the Serengeti, which we would have never experienced on a day long game drive, unless we had stayed in one of the camps. Game drive after dark was strictly prohibited. Although this was technically not a game drive, we saw a lot of animals that were relaxing and reclaiming their spaces, devoid of human interference. We startled a herd of imphalas as they were not expecting any vehicle to cross at that time. They sprinted in front of our vehicle, one of their jumping high enough to jump over the bonnet of our car. It was a beautiful sight to witness, the sunset and the imphala jumping across. We encountered wildebeest herds that were planning to retire for the night, after a day of grazing. This is when our driver slowed down and almost got the vehicle to a complete stop. We looked around and understood why.</p>
<p>Two big elephants, barely fifty metres away from our car swinging their ears rapidly and taking an aggressive, defensive position, ready to charge at us. Another, not so big one standing on the left of the road. It would be suicidal to move ahead, so the best we could do was indicate to the driver to back off some more and stay there and observe. This we had to indicate to him through sign language. But thankfully, in dire situations, when language fails, sign language comes to our rescue. He understood immediately and backed off for some distance. When we felt we had given them enough space, we sat silently and watched with bated breath. This was an adventure we were not prepared for. But it was one of the most exciting and tensed moments I have experienced. As we sat and watched, I understood why they were getting defensive. It was a herd of elephants with little ones. I soon knew that they wanted to cross the road.</p>

<p>One of them had crossed and the others were either planning to cross or just spend some time around grazing leisurely. But on seeing us, they felt the urgency to cross the road and stay together. It was several minutes till nothing happened. But we patiently waited, since we knew they would surely cross. Once the large female felt it was safe, she signaled and one by one, we saw the members of the herd cross the road. It reminded me of a traffic controller, stopping vehicles to allow school children to cross the road. It was such an endearing sight to see these sensible creatures care for the safety of their herd and take care of their young so well. A couple of juveniles crossed, then a smaller one crossed. A few minutes later, when we thought it was over, a really tiny fellow trotted across the street, strictly escorted by its mother or aunt. We thought that was all, but there came another one closely behind. Now we were looking when the large female would relax and waited for this signal to know that it was over. She still stood ground. So we knew there were more coming. And they did. Two more crossed before she waited for a few seconds and herself crossed the road. Then they waited till the little ones moved away to safety and finally all of them closed behind and moved away. They were so organised. And we were happy that we waited and gave them the space they command and deserve. After all, it was their territory we were in. We had not seen a single elephant all day and witnessing this sequence while we were busy driving home, when least expected, lifted my spirits and made me feel better.</p>

<p>Since we spent a good fifteen minutes waiting for this to happen, it had got dark and the night creatures had started coming out. The night jars and owls were active. The rodents were running across the road. We saw a cat like creature with striped bushy tail jump quickly and hid in the bushes, later we came to read about it and deduced it could be a rusty spotted genet, which is found in these regions and suited the description. A hare hopped across our path. And we could see glowing eyes all around. These were the antelopes and wildebeests that were looking at us. Experiencing the wilderness in daytime is a pleasant experience. But in nighttime, it is a whole different world. The creatures, the sound, the darkness, the glowing eyes, it starts to get mysterious and exciting. Although we did not pay for a night safari, we experienced it for sometime. And this was priceless. We had salvaged something out of our misfortune after all. A failed game drive with an unexpected night drive and witnessing the jungle in all its glory. It was adventurous and scary while it lasted. But once we came out of it, I would cherish it for a long time.</p>
