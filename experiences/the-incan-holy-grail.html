					<p>The early morning mist enhanced the view. I was surrounded by huge lush green mountains as our bus ascended, revealing various nooks and corners. The massive green mounds appeared to float in the mist, green rocks in a vast sea of white. The air was chilly outside our bus, getting colder with every bend of the ascent. I felt the excitement of having entered something sacred, something unspoilt and hidden. To reach this sacred site by walk might have been something more spiritual. I knew that no matter how many Inca sites we visited, Machu Picchu would be something very different, and now I knew why. It was not as much the site and the relatively unspoilt ruins. Remove these wonderful green fortresses around them, then the ruins are nothing but a set of stones arranged in interesting, functional formations. But the mountains are the ones adding to their mystique. The Incas had a high degree of aesthetic sense. Structural beauty was as important to them as the functional purpose. To choose a site as breathtaking as this, hidden and mystical, when setting up a secret capital, told a lot about the exquisite taste of these Incan rulers and their architects. They must have seen these conical shaped mountains hanging in the mist and thought of it as a gateway to their magnificent city they had conceptualized. The fact that Machu Picchu site was not found by Spanish conquerors meant that this location chosen was indeed secluded. The backdrop of the Huyana Picchu mountain, which for the most part of the year is covered by mist and clouds, is what makes the Machu Picchu iconic.</p>

<p>It was a difficult decision to visit Machu Picchu. Apart from the high costs, it was also the crowds that somehow diminished the feeling that we were in a secluded Incan shrine. Hoards of people taking selfies, posing in front of the ruins, groups of people marching with their guides with flags and long queues at the entrance. Everything made us almost turn back and run away. What comforted me were the reward of clear views of the landscape which distracted me from all else; a little mist that existed initially slowly gave way to the blues and greens. All along the view points, I could only keep looking at this beautiful site and imagine how the Incans felt living amidst such beautiful mountains. The site itself huge, unlike what I had perceived from the pictures, encompassing sleeping quarters, a school, sun temple, observatory and a sacrificial stone. However, from a distance, it looks like a beautiful arrangement of beads, like a necklace, without revealing much about the life of the Incas. Our guide explained to us about the perfect alignment of the sun temple to the summer and winter solstices and many such other astronomical precisions when it came to the structures. Nothing was accidental or arbitrary in the design.</p>
<p>Most people, as expected, were clamouring for that i-wuz-here picture of themselves in the foreground and the Huyana Picchu and the ruins in the background. However, this would diminish the entire view and somewhat make the picture look skewed. The Incans would not have imagined such an angle to their magnificent creation. They might not even have liked it aesthetically, I feel. The fact that all such pictures would also have tiny people wearing colourful clothes in the background would not help the picture either. But it helps to note that if one is indeed there for the pictures, the universal rule of being there early mornings, sometimes helps. I say sometimes because there is always a chance that one only photographs the foreground, the background being a sheet of white, thanks to the mist.</p>

<p>Walking around the ruins, a worthwhile detour we took was to the old Inca trail, which is the known original trail to this place and also happens to be the exact opposite side end of the mountain on which the modern road-route exists. Paved with stones, most of this trail was intact and haven&rsquo;t undergone any renovation. A short walk on the trail took us through some refreshing forests, with a lot of greenery and breathtaking views of the mountains they overlook. At all times, I was well aware of the the mammoth mountains that surrounded us in silent pose, just as they stood there for centuries guarding this site. A bridge (now unused and closed for visitors) is where our trek culminated. It was built with logs that join two section of boulders that are standing about two metres apart. The guide explained that the vulnerability of the simple bride made of logs was by design. One chop, and everyone was cut away from the site; not unlike many old school forts and castles.</p>
<p>The stories about these Incan sites are what creates the mystique around them, without the stories and the theories, they might just be a pile of boulders of various sizes and shapes. It is known that the Incans built to last. Their structures were able to withstand earthquakes, winds and any natural elements for eternity. The first level of protection was provided by the mountains themselves, given the remote location and height at which these sites are found. The boulders were astoundingly large in many of the structures, giving us an idea of the hard working nature of the Incans. The trail itself, built of stones were used by the Incans to walk kilometres, hike to the site regularly as they did not use any other mode of transport other than on foot. To imagine these structures getting built by sheer human power only shows the organization of the society of the Incans. The Incans employed no slavery but they did have some amount of stratification in society. But it wasn&rsquo;t the kind we imagine today or can find parallels in history. Work, or work-hours was an integral part of the barter system (in return for food) across society because there was no concept of money as far as anyone can tell. We also heard that the Machu Picchu site was built for the elite class - the priests, the architects, officials, administrators - these were considered the most priced assets who possessed the knowledge of the Incans. The working class, the peasants who actually built the site were not living here; they were living in small huts on top of the hills surrounding this site.</p>

<p>One of the most fascinating aspects of the Incans was their affinity towards astronomy (again, not as we know it today) and integrating the cosmos into their lives, rituals and architecture. The Milky Way was their guiding light, dictating most of their decisions. The Sun, Inti, was their God and the King was the Son of God, hence the unquestionable authority. Their priests were well-versed with astronomical concepts, constellations, cosmic phenomena and had integrated these into their agriculture, dwellings and rituals. They had believed that the existence of their race depended on the Milky Way, and, when they had observed that the Sun was slowly surely moving out of the Milky Way, they resigned to their eventual demise. When the Spanish Inquisitors attacked, and captured their King, they believed that it was their end, having obtained the sign already from the Cosmos.</p>
