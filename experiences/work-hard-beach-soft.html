					<p>As we drove farther to the west, the landscape changed from the usual
staple of large buildings with their even-larger parking lots, to one,
that in appearance, had a little more of what I conjure up in my mind
whenever I come across the word &lsquo;California&rsquo;. A friend of mine had once told me I&rsquo;d
fit right in because I was a tree-hugger. In the literal sense of that term,
at least, this seemed the most likely possibility as I witnessed here
some of the largest, tallest and oldest redwood trees; trees whose
circumference would have made me look like an insect hanging on to the
bark when attempting to hug one. Our spontaneous drive today took us
through a stretch of such trees, and, in preparation, had taken much lesser
time and effort than buying the packet of chips we were carrying for the
journey.</p>
<p>About 30 minutes ago we were at our workplace in a locality within the
Bay Area called Palo Alto. Memories of my workplace are always associated
with the dense, air-conditioned and sound-proofed interiors of an
office but on stepping outside, being greeted with a cold breeze that
was punctuated liberally with the whizzing past of countless auto-mobiles
just a few meters away on US-101. The free-way felt like a portal that
took me to office everyday and back obscuring all else around; especially the fact
that there was a large water body to the east and a mountain range to
the west that descended into the Pacific Ocean. On one of the days, post
my office hours, a decision was made to drive to the western edges of this land,
tracing the contour lines of the North American continent. Perhaps it
was the practicality or even the casual nature of it that makes it so
endearing today when I think about it. Or perhaps it is the sense of
loss and missed opportunities because we did it only once.</p>
<p>Our destination on that day was the Half Moon Bay, a small beach town
that was best visited during the summers. Seasonal privileges were
something not available to us, ultra-short-term visitors. As it was the month of
February, it was still a mix of bitter winter cold that was threatening to overstay
this year and an inviting Sun with blue skies that tempted one with promises
of warmer days to come. The weather was just perfect on the day we chose for this trip.
We stopped over for a quick snack at a hole-in-the-wall eatery and with
the practised and conditioned dependency on the navigation system in
our car proceeded to our destination. The businesses and busy intersections
were soon left behind and we could see a lot of individual homes with
a car, a truck or a trailer parked adjacent to them. I noticed that we were
obviously ascending, albeit gently. Soon even the homes and smaller
buildings diminished in number and it was clear that the roads were
passing through protected, forested areas. Traffic on the road was
now restricted to a very few cars, but I considered the probability of
crowded roads, had we chosen a summer weekend to drive to this beach,
which was only half an hour away from most of the Bay Area.</p>
<p>Half Moon Bay was known so for its shape, if one shared the imaginative
eyes of whoever named it so. As we arrived, the Sun was preparing to sign
off not just into the West but also far beyond what was the agreed timelines
for an official new day in the Eastern countries. However there was
still plenty of sunlight. I parked the car in the nearest slot available
which was incidentally a picturesque location in itself, as if the
car had just abruptly stopped at the edge of a cliff. A table and bench
nearby was quickly claimed by us for a short yet significant picnic that
was in race against the sun. A few feet below, the beach was getting
rid of its last few resilient visitors who were braving the cold and
making a last ditch effort to take in everything a beach had to offer;
well, everything except trying to get into the water; the water must
have been too cold for that season and that day. Some people were walking
dogs, who, quite evidently, did not understand their master&rsquo;s urgency in
hurrying back to the parked cars. It is essentially incomplete if
beaches do not have children losing themselves in the sand and the sea
or running behind their belongings that were being snatched away by
the elements but it was what it was; a boring evening with just a few
adults who had made it there on a busy working day. Looking far ahead
into the horizon I could spot a few lights belonging to floats, ships
or vessels of various sizes, all of them having something to do with
the larger city of San Francisco that was far north on the same coastline.</p>
<p>Eventually, and with complete disregard to any kinds of hope against
hope anyone might have, the beach was covered in darkness. The cliff-like patch
of land, where the car was parked was now a dark abyss with
only the sound of waves from the Pacific to give us any indication of
a beach beyond. The moment of return was here. It felt odd to realize the
opposite; that yet again that it would take just half an hour for returning
to our daily lives; this turned out like a visit to a movie theatre. In a
weird way, this short picnic did share that one trait with movies; it felt
terribly unreal back then, and it feels the same years after.</p>
