					<p>Leaving Bwindi Impenetrable rainforests was quite painful. Very soon we would be pushed from pristine rainforests to flatlands in no time, and it also meant dealing with more people. I took in my last sights and smells to the fullest - the starlit sky, the fresh cool mountain air and the huge dark shadows in the backdrop of the mountains that were not yet visible before day break. We had to leave at 6am, which meant most of the work, like packing up our tent, having a good cup of morning coffee and saying goodbyes to our hosts had to be done in the cold and in darkness. By around 6:15, our first Boda boda turned up, ready to take us. But we had to wait for another good 15 mins till the second one turned up. We would later learn that they were from the same family - father and son. We set out on two Boda bodas in the dark and cold morning on a bumpy dirt-track. I was scared initially since he was riding on small stones without slowing down and I knew if we fell down, we would be gravely wounded. But after a few minutes, I decided to stop worrying and rather submit to divine providence and as some African Matatu philosophy read &ldquo;Keep calm and Trust God&rdquo;. Then I started enjoying the chilly air numbing my nose and fingertips, the shadows of the mountains in the faint morning light, the fresh tea plantations and the dusty  road itself. Somehow at that moment, me and my boda boda driver and our little adventure was everything that mattered to me. I was afraid to distract him with small talk and take his concentration away from the road. So I decided to wait till the rising Sun lit up the road ahead of us.</p>
<p>The mud road, dusty, winding through villages, around tea estates was a beautiful sight. There was some dew on the roadside grass and leaves of shrubs and trees. It was not the first time I was travelling on a bike through Africa, but it was the first time that I travelled in such early hours with hardly any light, with stars above my head and cold chilly morning air hitting my face. Also, for miles, there were no other people on the roads other than our two boda bodas. With a heavy backpack balancing on my lap and another one - even heavier - in front of the boda boda driver, it was actually like three people travelling on the bike instead of two. I turned my head a little to the left to see the flickering headlight of the boda boda following closely behind and knew that we were okay. Visibility was limited due to the mist but slowly as the light started increasing, I could see more of the greenery around, extending as far as my eyes could see. The sky started to turn blue slowly from dull grey, with clouds breaking the blue canvas. There were small villages on the way but when we started, most of the villagers were still asleep.</p>
<p>After about halfway, we could start seeing signs of life all along the road. What looked like a forest road soon turned out to be hubs of human activity. I could see children wearing school uniforms walking to school in ones and twos. Some men were carrying milk cans and travelling on their bicycles. Women were found sweeping their yard. And slowly, the vehicles started, although not many.</p>
<p>Football is a game that unites Africans, starts conversations and builds bonds. Knowing this, I asked my boda boda driver whether he plays football and he said &ldquo;yes yes&rdquo;. And he immediately asked me &ldquo;which team?&rdquo; as though I am a player. I was taken aback. But I knew at once what he meant. There are fan clubs of the famous football clubs like Arsenal, Manchester United and the others. We often see people wearing t-shirts with their favourite team names and player jerseys. I answered &ldquo;Man-U&rdquo;, a short form of Manchester United, that I had only recently learnt. He said &ldquo;Me too&rdquo; and then we knew we were friends. He opened up after this and asked me where I was from to which I replied &ldquo;India&rdquo;. Then there were a few queries about India itself like whether people speak the same language there or how big the country is. I answered his questions in short phrases to ensure he understood what I said. I also mentioned that the bike he was riding was made in India, to which he grinned widely. Most bikes that are found in Africa were made by Bajaj or TVS and imported. It probably had something to do with good mileage too. It is surprising how they have adopted these bikes as their own and are proud of it. Most cars were from Japan, mostly Toyota. So I saw that there was a huge market for these vehicles here. An occasional Tata or Mahindra were also spotted.</p>
<p>The sun had filled up the sky with its brightness and the ride was no longer treacherous; at the same time it had also lost its charm. The journey ended at Kihiihi, which was more of a smallish town although the locals called it a village. The boda boda father-son duo stopped when we arrived at a taxi-stand and handed us over to the taxi drivers who would take us through our next phase of this journey. We bid farewell to our companions, and saw huge smiles on their faces as soon as we paid them a little extra than the agreed amount. The road from here was exciting as it would take us through Ishasha, which is part of the Queen Elizabeth National park. For now, we had to rest a bit, eat some breakfast and wait for fellow passengers to come and board the shared taxi.</p>
