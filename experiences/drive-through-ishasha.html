					<p>On the streets of the small town Kihiihi, we sat found an empty taxi and quickly boarded it. As we had the breakfast that we had packed from Bwindi, we saw that the shops were just starting to open. We saw them getting ready for the day by arranging their display pieces outside and cleaning the entrances. There were many people all dressed up and purposeful, walking in a single direction and very excited. Since it was a Sunday, I figured that they were going to church for the morning mass. As we waited, another person entered the taxi and sat in the front seat. He had also some packed Mandazi (buns) and he ate it as he waited.</p>
<p>After an hour and a half of this inactivity, the taxi owner (or manager) came and informed us that we would leave soon. He even issued tickets. Another passenger entered and sat next to me in the back seat. So now we were four. At this point a guy walked out of nowhere, discussed something with the manager and - to my surprise - took some money from him and sat in the driver&rsquo;s seat. It was thus established that he was our driver. So we set off, but in the opposite direction of where we had to go (as per my reliable phone GPS). Two minutes later, I figured out why. As it was customary around here, the taxis will first collect money from passengers then stop at the first fuel station to fill petrol. And only then the journey really starts. Then we set off on a bumpy dirt track with some local music playing on the car stereo.</p>
<p>Coming from Bwindi, which was mostly mountainous, we were now driving through vast plains; mostly grassland with a few trees. The change in the terrain was dramatic and sudden for me. I missed the hills but the landscape here gave me something new to look forward to. This place was famous for groups of lions that seemed to have taken to the idea of climbing the lower hanging branches of the trees and spending an airy afternoon up there; amusing and photogenic. So, I started staring into the foliage of every tree we passed, trying my luck.</p>
<p>Soon, we came across land rovers with tourists starting off on their game drives into what was the national park. There were several side tracks to the dirt track we were moving on, that was used for safaris to spot wildlife and go closer to them. In fact, it is only then that the realization struck me how under very different circumstances, I am in different vehicles. And also how fluid these boundaries between civilization and the wild were. Since we were on a public road in a taxi on the given day, I tried to make the best use of the &ldquo;free ride&rdquo; through a national park. Of course, the people in our car did not share the same excitement as us. I gasped and exclaimed each time I saw a deer,  an Impala or a Topi. For me these were exotic. I knew that some of these species were not found in India. It was unfortunate that I was not able to photograph them as my current driver was not a safari tour operator, he was paid just enough to take us across to the next town. So I had to suppress our excitement and not act very touristy. But I used all my spotting skills to see whatever best I could. There were some extremely colourful birds (probably starlings) and hornbills that I spotted. Then, there was even a monkey that looked very different from what I have ever seen (later I deduced that it could be a blue monkey or a mangabey); it was only a fleeting moment when it was sighted and i do not have the pictures to verify, so I can never be precise.</p>
<p>I was just beginning to feel comfortable with the taxi ride when suddenly we were stopped by four people on two bikes. I could see that one of the bikes had some problem and it was clear that they wanted to head to town. I counted and deduced, from my limited understanding of such dynamics, that we could pick up a max of two more people. The two of us, tourists were asked to alight and move to the front seat; both of us had to share a single seat, so the driver in an act of generosity gave a padding to make up for the lack of seat below. Three of the four bikers were pushed in the back-seat along with the existing passenger. I was wondering where the original passenger in the front seat went, when he suddenly entered from the driver&rsquo;s side sat in the driver&rsquo;s seat. The driver soon nudged him in and sat next to him to closed the door. Now, we were  4 people in the front and 4 in the back-seat in a taxi that should ideally take a grand total of 4. To shift the gears, the driver had to know go across the legs of the person next to him. To me, this had turned hilarious if not dangerous. But we moved on.</p>
<p>Our journey continued, with us unable to move our arms or legs. We could move our necks from side to side though, which we did rapidly to spot any wildlife on the road or on the trees along the roadside. There was no sign of the famous tree climbing lions. Well, not even the regular ones which restrain themselves to the Terra-firma. It was naive of me of course. People would not put in enormous amount of time and money in game drives if they could spot wildlife along a public road. But then again, I did spot vervet monkeys and groups of baboons on the roadside. And later we also saw something cross the road far away and I got excited as I saw that it was not a small animal. The way it walked, it had to be one of the great apes. As the car approached closer, we could only see the backside of this animal and I knew it was a chimpanzee as this place is one of the habitats for chimpanzees. We were lucky to have shifted to front row seats in the car as we could have easily missed seeing it otherwise. Our &ldquo;free game drive&rdquo; was progressing well and we were already satisfied with it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I realized that our driver was doing another type of spotting. His eagle eyes were fixated upon a man on the road asking for a ride. I was sure that the only place that he might fit in was inside the boot or on top of the car. But to my - and our collective - astonishment, the driver stopped and decided to accommodate him. He opened the boot and put his luggage inside and then opened the backdoor! Just as he was asking the new person to &ldquo;somehow&rdquo; squeeze inside, a fight started between the driver and one of the passengers. Finally, the driver showering abuses, the passenger&rsquo;s argument won and the new guy was unceremoniously left on the road, and we continued. One of the passengers abruptly decided that he disagreed with the driver&rsquo;s music choices too, in addition to the other disagreements they had about vacant spaces. So he now switched on his own music from a mobile phone. We moved on with two different tunes competing with each other as we drove through the national park.</p>
<p>After some point, with no sign of lions, the road through the national park ended by joining another highway and I was relieved to be driving on tarmac again. The driver speeded up and started signalling something to the drivers of taxis coming from the opposite direction. Whether he was just saying a hi or was warning them of some police checking, I was not too sure. As we were driving towards Kasese, our next destination, I could feel the heat rising and I soon found out why. We were passing through the Earth&rsquo;s equator. There were large arches, rather, rings, on either side of the road (about 2 metres diameter) with a board &ldquo;Ugandan Equator&rdquo;. I was thrilled to see this. It was definitely a photograph moment but our driver did not even slow down. It was the fourth time we were crossing the equator during the African journey, although it was the first time I saw this sign. Soon afterwards, we passed across a channel which connected two huge lakes on either side, Lake Edward and Lake George. There were people boating in the lakes and it was evident that it was a tourist spot. Either side looked beautiful with a lot of greenery all around the lakes. A lot of water birds were flying low and many of them were wading in the lake too.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, I noticed that the driver was looking nervous and was trying to hide something. He had taken out 5000 shillings from his pocket and was hiding it under his palm as he held the steering wheel. I was not sure what was going on. But I guessed that he had to pay someone. One thing was certain, whomsoever he had to pay, had to be paid in secret. My doubts were confirmed as we passed a police check-post and soon he stopped the car and ran towards the policemen. When he came back, the note was gone. It must have been a bribe he had to pay off for flouting some traffic rules; not sure what, but I confidently guessed that it could be overcrowding. After that event, he looked relaxed again. We were too, but for another reason. We were very close to our destination, Kasese.</p>
