					<p>I had this strange feeling of undeserved-ness when we sat there. My toes
were digging into the sand into which a lot other tiny life forms were
running into. The sea spoke with the same fervour, sometimes a little of it
even caressing us as tiny droplets. It was just too good, just too real
for it to be happening to us. The beach stretched miles to either side;
usually we would be sharing it with a whole lot of humanity. But
here we were, just the two of us. Our lodging was somewhere behind us,
far off in fact, past the thicket and the coconuts and a lot of
land. The darkness of the sky above was only measured and ascertained
by the brightness of the stars. I had seen dark skies before, for a
fleeting moment here and there but never so consistently and never so
thoroughly before as here at Neil island. To our luck, it was also a moonless night,
which turned the sky above into a perfect planetarium.</p>
<p>Anyone who chose not to ask us about our plans to Neil Island and just
observed us from a distance would mistake all of this to be some sort
of well planned tour with a meticulously prepared tour guide; offbeat
stays and breathtaking experiences. But the truth is the opposite. Us
meeting Srivas in a public boat was as much chance as our gamble with
finding a boat on a busy day. Even when we settled into the modest room
that he offered to us, I hadn&rsquo;t even begun imagining that the best part
was yet to come. The corner of Neil island where we were was as expected
remote, with only a few scattered buildings, most of it homes, some
large enough to be assumed as businesses. But it was evident that it
was either the low season for business or we were lucky enough to have found
a remote part of the village which was away from the touristy resorts.
We seemed to be the only tourists around that week.</p>
<p>We had walked to the beach after a homely dinner that was provided to
us by Srivas&rsquo;s sister-in-law at a little shack that was reminiscent of
the various eateries that I had visited in Goa. The thatched roof, the
cane chairs with the cane table and glass-top, shelf full of books with dog
eared pages - most of it guides to Andaman - the hammocks, the artistically
painted handwritten signs, they were all there. Dinner
was an extremely simple affair with some rice and lentils, and it was
as we gratefully gulped it down, that one of us first brought up the fact
that we could hear the sea. From then on it was a hurried event with
the goodnights and the thank yous. Off we went. I had my little torch
that froze every little creature on the floor that up until then thought
it was lurking away into the dark. The floor changed from a mixture of
soil and sand to just sand as we got closer to the source of sound, and
then abruptly, as always, we arrived at the beach just as we went past a
rock on one side and a coconut tree on the other. From there the land
simply tapered slowly into the sea.</p>
<p>I struggled to pick a spot to sit because I was still coping with what
was above. The past experiences being so diminished in time meant that
I couldn&rsquo;t trust that this would last. So as we kicked out a few of
the weeds and runners on the floor to make some space to sit, I&rsquo;d look
up again and ensure it was all there, before looking down into the sand
and laying out a towel. Then I would look up again in distrust.
Soon I realized that I&rsquo;d have to let go of my apprehensions. This
particular sky, this day, this place was benevolent. The sky was simply
this dark and this beautiful to look it, perhaps every night. No. But
perhaps on most nights. I remembered Srivas telling us about the bad
seasons when it rained hard and the boats rocked so much that one feared
for one&rsquo;s life. So not perhaps every night or every season. But tonight
was the night when nothing came between the observer and the observable
universe. And what a sight it was.</p>
<p>Billions of stars were visible in the sky. And most importantly, that
little patch which we all can spot faintly, almost as an elongated blur
like a cloud and is in fact layers and layers of the stars of our own
galaxy, came into being. The Milky Way. The more I stared into the
darkness above, the better the experience was getting. New stars revealed
themselves as I paused and focussed a bit more. The all too familiar
ones which I had seen even from the cities, even their constellations
were suddenly a distraction; old friends constantly vying for attention
while I was trying and make an impression on new ones. After staring for
a few minutes it was apparent that the large blurry cloud was composed
of further small blurry clouds and many other distinct spots, patches
and lines, all of which were compositions and creations of my own mind
but were in reality just stars and stars and more stars.</p>
<p>My neck ached from the posture I had to assume while watching the sky
lest it ran away or simply ended the show. But I was more trusting now
and the sky was in no mood for bad behaviour. I could take my eyes off,
ease my posture and look into the dark horizons which itself was full
of stars. But the darkness at the very bottom, where the sky meets the
Indian Ocean was where I was fixated. Staring into it meant staring into
some very large distances, perhaps all the way into the South Pole, or
perhaps into the Nicobar Islands which we wouldn&rsquo;t be visiting but was
farther to the South. I decided to lie down on the towel with its sandy
cushioning. The feeling of undeserved-ness, the fear of betrayal and the
unfortunate seasonal bad luck, all of that seemed to have been alleviated
now. The dark sky with the milky-way seemed like an eternal truth in
that little beach we had walked into. If anything would break up this
trance, this moment, that guilty party would only be me, who would at
some point due to elemental and biological reasons, unable to bear the
night and the cold slowly retreat into the safety of my lodging. Till
then I could just lie there and merge into this omnipresent truth. And
that is just what I did for another hour or so.</p>
