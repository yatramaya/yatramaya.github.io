					<p>If I had one favourite species, which bird would I really like to see? That
was the question posed to me by Ricardo, our guide. My ambitious yet truthful answer
to his question was, the Harpy&rsquo;s Eagle. Ricardo smiled and I returned it. But we
weren&rsquo;t kidding each other. The bird watching experience here in the Amazon was
supposed to be bit different, and by different, I mean very challenging when
compared to what I had experienced up until then, back home. The birds were not
out in the open and are harder to spot. The canopy is dense, with very
little light escaping to the under-storey of the forest. Photography was
going to be a luxury. And yet, there I was, challenging my guide. If Ricardo
had any lesser confidence, then he did not show it. Having said that, he did
admit to having seen the Harpy&rsquo;s Eagle only a few times in his entire life. And
he has lived in the Amazon rainforests all his life.</p>

<p>One of the first birds that he spotted for me happened to have no qualms
about being out there in the open. Someone like Ricardo could spot it over a
thousand times a day. But that was him. Me, I scanned the entire canopy left
and right and up and down through my binoculars only to find foliage and branches each time. This was
till he setup his monocular and focused it on the bird. The time was about 11.30am
and the sun was being harsh on us. From where we stood, I could see this bird was
sleeping like a log, literally, because it blended in so well that one would
expect it to be just an offshoot of a branch or some torn-off bark. He told me it
was the Greater Pootoo. It had its mouth open as if it was just about to say
something before it dozed off. The Pootoo is a nocturnal bird from the same
family as the Srilankan Frogmouth. If I thought I had chanced upon a rare one
that that was snoring away, I was wrong. I was to see many more Pootoos during
this trip, and coincidentally, all of them sleeping during the day.</p>
<p>It is hard to describe birdwatching in the Amazon without remembering the simple
fact that there are insects involved; millions of them. Perhaps billions of them.
This was especially true when we were walking through the
really dense parts. Every kind of insect that I could imagine, every little
creepy-crawly, was somewhere around us. Some of them were calling
out loud. When one wailed like an approaching train another one shrieked. Amidst
all this fertile symphony, Ricardo would always still manage to track a bird
calling somewhere. Then either of the following would happen. He would walk ahead a
little faster than us and then stop and signal us to follow suit when I&rsquo;d wait
quietly till he setup his monocular and call me closer. Or, as we paused and
contemplated, we would hear a tell-tale rustle in the understory and something
would fly from one end of the forest to the other.</p>

<p>I was overwhelmed by the experience of seeing so many birds; the kind I had never seen before. As if to
explicitly make a point that the Amazon, in itself wasn&rsquo;t beautiful enough,
the birds wore colours here that were so bright, I had to pinch myself before
admitting to the fact that I wasn&rsquo;t looking at some modern or urban object like
a piece of plastic or a fallen kite. Ricardo introduced me to one of the most
colourful of them all. The Paradise Tanager; it was just one among a very large
family of Tanagers. It was a kaleidoscope of colours; I think I actually counted
seven different colours on one. And of course, as is usually the case, it was
the male of the species that was the most colourful and
flamboyant. And when they were not approaching us to make a quick inspection,
after which they would vanish into the foliage to avoid us, they were all busy
calling out and impressing their partners.</p>

<p>During most of the time that I spent with our guide, I miserably failed to spot
birds myself. But I&rsquo;d have to mention that I kept getting better at it. It took some
getting used to. I started noticing when Ricardo would get distracted at first and start looking
around, mid-conversation. Next, he would go silent and look intently somewhere. All I
needed to do was to look in that direction. After a few attempts I started seeing
them even before he setup his monocular. One of the birds that I spotted pretty
easily was the Toucan. Like many, I had seen only a comical and animated version
of the Toucan in a Disney feature. Having said that, I&rsquo;d have to mention that, with
their large distinct eyes, bursting colours containing deep reds, blues, yellows
and such, these birds seemed to me as unreal as their artistic versions. In
fact this statement would also be true about a far cousin of this bird that I
have seen many a times back at home in the Western Ghats; the Hornbill. We spotted
the Emerald Toucanet, the White-Throated Toucan and the Channel-Billed Toucan
but what impressed me was the Curl-Crested Aracari which was a smaller
bird from the Toucan family with a distinctive curled hairstyle!</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t always that, we had to seek out the birds. There were times when
they surprised us with a visit instead. Sometimes all it took was to look up. The
bright blue sky, that due to the height of the trees I had to strain my neck to scan,
was filled with Macaws that were flying about, usually in groups. Similar to the
familiar parakeets, I could relate to their behaviour. What was unrelatable though was
the variety in colours. The Macaws come in far more colours than the humble parakeets; from
red to yellow, blue to golden and orange to green; various combinations of them.
If it was not the sky, then it was the highest branches of a bare
tree; where we sometimes easily spotted birds. One of the memorable sightings was a
White Hawk female, who after surveying the surroundings and ensuring that we were at least half
a kilometre away, proceeded to gently rest on her nest, presumably incubating
her eggs. It was one of those times when Ricardo was more excited than me.</p>

<p>When they weren&rsquo;t up in the sky, they were very close to us, but without
making themselves visible. There were hundreds of them and it would
be a fact, known only to Ricardo, as to how many birds we did not spot. There
was one call I started recognizing so much so that it was our travel companion.
The Screaming Peehaw is a bird I cannot forget; rather, its call is what I
am talking about because I never once saw it. For me, its loud call has become
synonymous with the sounds of the Amazon itself. The call is so distinct; it
seems admonishing, mocking and insulting, all at the same time. It was as if
that bird would walk with you to get you out of its
territory. In a world that was not filled with so many colourful rivals, perhaps
I would have spotted one but the Screaming Peehaw remains an aural memory for me.
At the same time it would be unfair of me to not mention that the forest did
produce many other bird calls that weren&rsquo;t as loud or rowdy as the Peehaw. We were
constantly kept alert when something whistled or hooted around us; dull sounds
as if they were remarking or sighing at our self inflicted misery.</p>
<p>Outside the forest one day we spotted a large bird. Some of the locals
called it a Condor. Ricardo was missing in action at that point but I happen
to be pretty sure from later identification that what we saw was the King
Vulture. But that wasn&rsquo;t the only Vulture we saw that day. We
came across the Turkey Vulture and Black Vulture whenever we got closer to the
banks of the river. They were always flying so high that and it was a
matter of quickly identifying them well within the time we had before they
flew into the canopies on either side. By the river and also in
the well lit clearings I could put my limited skills to good use when I identified
birds from some of the families I was familiar with; Kingfishers, Doves, Woodpeckers
and Hummingbirds; Great Billed Hermit, White Necked Jacobin, Violet Headed, Blue
Tailed Emerald, Golden Tailed Sapphire and the Fork Tailed Woodnymph. When it
came down to Hummingbirds, it was like a trip to &ldquo;adjective heaven&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But there were birds that we could not hope to see when the skies were blue. And
they did not sleep nonchalantly with their mouths open either. The owls. We had many
sessions planned when we went out on night-patrols for spotting the birds that
refuse to come out when the sun was out. I half expected to run into a Greater
Pootoo again but never did; but into owls, we did. Many a times the owls simply
flew past us with an unmistakable &ldquo;whoosh&rdquo; that was so soft that it was hard to
detect unless accompanied by a quick glance. But they were always calling, just
out of our reach and in the dead of the night, with their calls echoing seemingly
from everywhere in the dense forest, it was quite the challenge to actually
find the source. There was a rare occasion when once Ricardo imitated the calls
of one of the Screech-Owls and within a few minutes it actually came flew towards
us from the forest and sat on a branch that was jutting out into the riverside.
The sunset, the silhouette of the bird and our own darkening contours are all
an integral part of my memory now.</p>
