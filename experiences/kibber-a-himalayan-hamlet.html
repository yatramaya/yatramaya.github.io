					<p>Depending on what or who the source of information is, Kibber,
an idyllic village that adorns the cold and silent Spiti Valley
with its warm and bright coloured houses will rest in all sorts
of record books. Needless to say, whether Kibber really hosted
India&rsquo;s highest post office or the rugged roadway that led us
there should be considered for a motorcyclist bucketlist, it
being the the highest motorable road, is all a matter of debate.</p>
<p>My visit to Kibber was in the month of October when the
Lesser Himalayas are still pleasant and accessible. The blues
of the sky were an ideal companion to the various shades
of brown that were presented by the landscape around. Far
beyond, as if ever-present in an unmoving background, were
the large mountains that seperated the valley from the highlands
of Tibet and the mammoth China. The bus that I was in slowly
trudged its way up the road. Unlike us mere mortals who do
this due to the high altitude, what affected the bus was
perhaps its old age and rundown nature. When most of the
crowd got off at the Key Monastery which is a short 1 km
detour enroute to Kibber from Kaza, I sat there holding onto
my bag that was ever so eager to jump out through the
rear exit that lacked a door. The friendly bus conductor of
the Himachal Road Transport Corporation got chatty at this
point and I learnt that the bus retires for the day in the
next village and based on a long standing deal between his
employer and the friendly people of the village, he and the
driver were supplied food and shelter on a rotation basis.</p>
<p>A few days ago, while passing by the main road that connects
Kaza to Manali, I had seen Kibber from afar but now, kilometers
closer to it, it was mysteriously engulfed by the various
folds of the mountains. It is quite ironic that stillness and
silence are the two words that stand out when witnessing this
landscape. It is no wonder that these lands are predominantly
Buddhist in nature which puts silence and stillness of the mind
on a pedestal. After navigating many more curves that also
brought up our elevation to close to 4200 meters from the
sea level the windshield of the bus was the first to reveal to
me a cluster of homes that were mostly white and black with
blue, red and yellow enhancing the contours and lines. The
building that stood out was at a higher elevation. The Kibber
Monastery.</p>
<p>Norling Homestay is the place I had chosen for protecting
myself from the elements in these far reaches of the Spiti
Valley. The elements here did test my physical ability and
more so my mental strength; altitude sickness was the reason.
Kibber could be approached from the southern section of
Himachal Pradesh via Manali &gt; Rohtang Pass or from the
opposite side via Shimla &gt; Kalpa. By choosing the Manali
route I had shortened my trip duration but accelerated
my ascent. This had meant that I had shorter time for
acclimitazation and would now need to spend time at Kibber
itself trying to get rid of my AMS symptoms.</p>
<p>Kibber is the gateway to the Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary which is
a cold desert housing various creatures that have adapted
to this trecherous climate including the elusive Snow Leopard.
Snow leopards which spent quite some time on the Endangered
list are now classified as Vulnerable, which is but only a slight
improvement and the animal is still considered to be living
at the mercy of our individual and collective actions which
unfortunately also includes global actions such as rapid
climate change that is driving the treelines in the Himalayas
higher, thereby altering the habitats of these creatures. Some
discussions I had with my host revealed that the village plays
host to various expeditions that are dedicated to spotting
these elusive creatures but one would have to come back
in a more suitable season, suitable for snow leopards that is.</p>
<p>I bid my time trying to get rid of an annoying headache by
spending it on the homestay&rsquo;s terraces. Norling Homestay
being at one of the upper layers meant that I could use the
space as an observatory of sorts. This game of mine included
spending long periods of time witnessing the HPRTC bus that
at first appeared as a dot in the distance and then slowly
entered the village at its peripheries to vanish behind the
buildings and structures and to finally appear right under
my homestay to climb up behind it and head to Chicham which
was the next settlement a few kilometers away. When I wasn&rsquo;t
on this important mission, I spent the time photographing
some of the daily life in the village which involved quite a
bit of livestock rearing. Witnessing the early morning activity of
releasing large heards from their confinements led me to a
conversation with the host on the topic of Snow Leopards again
wherein I heard they did take away a sheep here or there once
in a while.</p>
<p>The not so steep inclines that surrounded Kibber were the
cultivated areas. Despite the all round cold weather, Kibber
is one of the places that produced a lot of agricultural goods.
In fact for eons now, generations of villagers have been
trading with Ladakh via a trek route that exists between
these places. Barley and the rare Black Peas (similar to the
Green Peas) is what I understood to be the major produce; the
Black Peas being a much less in popularity but a high nutrient,
resilient and traditional variety. However, much like anywhere
else in the world, the older folk from Kibber detested the fact that
the younger men and women were now driven more by the
economical instruments that came in from the South that
included Kaza and Shimla from far south, which included
the hospitality and tourism segments.</p>
<p>A couple of days after, I was courageous enough to crawl out
of my hole to try and explore the surroundings of Kibber. The
rest time had helped; I felt active and bright. This could be
said of the weather too which was sunny and bright but not
hot at all. The cool constant breeze which is a given in these
parts egged me on a walk along the road that had around
a turn gulped up the bus innumerable times. Unlike in my
imagination, that road after turning was descending for a
few feet and then it looped back and forth while Kibber
could be viewed from the opposite end from many places.
Yaks could be seen grazing in what I believe were uncultivated
pastures. My walk took me in the general direction of Chicham
through some ups and downs but none of them steep enough
to tire me. Some minor deliberate detours I took got me
perfect views of the mountains that surrounded the valley.
What also caught my attention was the faint sound of the
river that was flowing through a narrow, deep and rather
intimidating canyon that it had carved out in the land between
Kibber and Chicham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chichampul&rdquo; (Chicham Bridge) as it is known isn&rsquo;t any sort
of spectacle when one first spots it on the approach path.
But walking closer to it and on it I got to see first hand why
the locals were excited talking about it. The bridge apparently
took more than a decade to complete. I wasn&rsquo;t surprised to
hear that because of the imposing unfriendly terrain that
surrounded it let alone the usual challenges that plague such
work. While I took a short walk over it to the other side to
take some pictures, a van arrived and parked at one end of
the bridge and a group wearing cycling gear of all colours
and kinds arrived. While we interchanged some smiles, a
mini truck arrived on which were rows of racing bicycles.
I understood that this was a cycling expedition that was to
begin from here, expedited with the help of the truck. I said
goodbye to the bridge and walked in the direction of Kibber
while the cyclists one by one picked up their wheels and
headed in the direction of Chicham; the road snaking to
that village now looked like a necklace with colourful beads
when they got far enough.</p>
<p>Back in the village I decided to pay a visit to the Gompa. My
host had mentioned that due to whatever alignment of the
stars, I had ended up in Kibber in the same week when there
was some religious festivities due. Asking if the attire I had
in my backpack was inoffensive for the gompa as well as for
the specifics events of the day, and upon relief that it was
completely okay, I headed out to the Monastery. The place
was slowly getting populated by the locals who were streaming
into the place one by one. One of the gentlemen I recognized
as the person who had walked with me up the little path
that lead up to the Gompa. He smiled and I returned the same.
On inquiring around, I understood that an important Lama
was to visit from the Key Monastery nearby. I picked a corner
to rest my back and elbows while I take pictures while the
compound that was designated for the events filled up in its
peripheries. There were children lining up the compound wall
with some standing against it and other sitting on it. The
village men were running around purposefully and discussing
astutely matters that I presume were logistical. Women of
all ages took positions in a little gallery like space and
overflowed into the stairs that lead up to one side of the Gompa
that now doubled as seating arrangement. Everyone was
dressed for the occasion, especially the women. Many wore
copious amounts of jewellery that was made of either
whitemetal or silver along with a large trophy-belt like item
that they wore over their shoulders with hundreds of stones
affixed to them. The stones were blueish for the most part
but some women also wore coloured ones that added further
enhanced their attire for the day. The men were mostly wrapped
in a very thick coat with some of them wearing a waist belt
that again had colourful beads. Woollen shawls and drapes
were a unisex wardrobe choice and everyone had it. The
children however had come in their daily wear; some walking
next to their parents and some on their colourful mother&rsquo;s
backs. Anticipation was in the air and the number of smiles
I exchanged were proof of the happiness the locals wanted
to share with an outsider like me.</p>
<p>It was a rather long wait and although Kibber has only a
handful of families there seemed to be a lot to share and
talk about. I meanwhile stared at a musical instrument that
with its leather and fur intact, looked like the animal it was
made out of. While considering what the instrument was,
there was a commotion in the corner and some of the boys
who had volunteered themselves to be sentries were now
shouting something. I saw that an SUV had turned the first
corner that leads to Kibber in the southern end. The SUV took
another ten minutes of zigzagging down that hill before it
entered the village and then arrived at the Gompa gate
below. Everyone left their favourite seats and proceeded to the
gate and took up positions on either side of the path that
lead from the gate to the compound. I sneaked in behind the
crowd in an unsuccessful attempt to blend into the crowd.
The last thing I wanted was undue attention when someone
important was visiting the Gompa. A Lama, with all the
bearings that one would associate with a man of position
in religious circles, got off the SUV and along with his
calvacade started walking towards us. Some individuals holding
thin long strips of cloth handed it to him and obtained his
blessings. When he entered the Gompa some followed him
in while others sat back outside. This is when a few men
took centerstage and the music began. The drumbeating
was reminiscent of the kind I had only once or twice heard
in person before and that was in a Buddhist setting somewhere
in southern India. The crowd around was listening to it
intently with some of the older folks offering nods of approval
at certain places during the song. Considering that I had to
bid adieu to Kibber on the same day and to avoid further
imposition of my self on welcoming village folk, I stealthly
made an exit.</p>
<p>My host made it clear that I could maximize my time in my
room till he got news of the bus actually starting off from
Chicham and its stop would be right at the homestay&rsquo;s gate.
Having got used to running around and anxiously waiting for
my transport, this option was a welcome change. So I packed
up all of my goods, wore some warm clothes, but relaxed and
loitered on the terrace. My host who joined me spoke at
length about his new found interest in reading novels and
other literature. He spoke about the challenge of getting
the books as well as needing some recommendations. I promised
him that on return to my own home, I would parcel him a set
of good books. If one of India&rsquo;s highest post offices was also
reasonably efficient enough, then he would get his hands on
some new literature. While we bantered and laughed, he
sharpened his hearing and then declared that the bus was
very close. Thanking him and his family I departed from the
homestay just in time to catch the bus. While the now
familiar and friendly faces of the driver and conducter smiled
at me, I paused on the entrance stairs of the bus to look
back at Kibber that was now vanishing behind a curtain
of dust.</p>
