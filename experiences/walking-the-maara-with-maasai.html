					<p>&ldquo;Could you repeat that?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Born during the rains from Sangok,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He was taller than me but not so
tall as to undeniably fit the bill as a typical Masai; anywhere between 35 and
40 years of age. He wore a traditional Masai outfit that betrayed a bit of its
costume nature thanks to being prim, proper and perhaps ironed out. A day before
that, during the drive here I had seen a few Masai villagers who walked the
road, with dust that refused to part with their faces and clothes. What they
were wearing were similar in colours and texture but apparently focussed on the
functional. Perkurere Ole Sangok, who was talking to us now had more of the
trinkets and ornaments around him that danced about as he waved his hands or
bobbed his head. He was cheerfully explaining the meaning of his long name to
us because I had inquired.</p>
<p>Kennedy is what he initially introduced himself as, when we met him at the gates
of Maara Xplorers. He was to be our guide, driver and all-in-all for the next
few days during our stay. Currently, the two of us were walking with him towards
a crossroad between the dirt-track that led from the Safari Resort and another
one that came in from the nearby Village. That was when I had asked him what
his native name was. I wasn&rsquo;t even sure if there existed a concept of a native
name before I asked the question. Somehow, the setting, his mannerism, his
mention of the village made me feel like Kennedy was an easier name he was using
for tourism purposes or was an official Christian name he had been given.</p>
<p>As we approached a junction of sorts, a tall lanky man with a thin frame
appeared and after looking at us with a momentarily reassured face just stood
there right in the centre of the road, a bit fidgety. In comparison, he was much
taller than Kennedy. He had the kind of hair texture that I associated with
indigenous people of this area; i.e. very sparse and in small clumps. He had managed to
concoct for himself a frenchie that was betraying his age. He also had those large
bulbous eyes with a lot of white around that expressed surprise even when one wasn&rsquo;t.
He seemed more anxious than surprised when we all approached him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jackson,&rdquo; said Kennedy as he proudly introduced his colleague to us.</p>
<p>We shook hands and Jackson immediately eased out a bit. But he also seemed to be averse
to any more of the niceties and took off on one of the branches from the crossroads
that was leading towards the hillock that I had spotted many a times from within
the peripheries of Maara Xplorers. The fence of the resort was visible at a
distance in the left and we would probably see it for a few good minutes as
we walked. After that it looked like mostly shrubs of the same variety that I
have seen in pictures of the Maara but more densely packed; mostly Acacias. On
the right, I could spot a few roofs of buildings. Very close to us and behind
us was what I thought a residence, a fact betrayed by the visuals of a woman who
was handling her cow; tying it to a pole. The cow itself was the leanest version of
the specimen that I had seen up until then.</p>
<p>I promised myself to not forget to ask Jackson his real name too, but for later.
Kennedy explained to us that our plan was to walk the dirt track beyond the
outskirts of this village and up the higher ground, parts of which looked like
managed or cultivated land and then trek up the hillock and then loop around
the resort and return from the other end. I digested what he said quickly and
considering we were already executing the plan, relaxed and enjoyed the walk
itself. It was exhilarating to know that I was walking the plains that I had
seen so many times in pictures, movies and documentaries. Our safari through
the same landscape the previous day was a different kind of experience but one
that clearly lacked this intimate contact one gets while walking. From the
limited vantage point of my height and the considerably slower by speed one
achieves while walking, the Maara looked very different. I noted it to be very
similar to the landscape I had seen back in India in the state of Tamil Nadu.
Perhaps all of Maara was comparable, now that I think about it, or was it just
that section we had walked through?</p>

<p>What was not similar was just the fact that in these parts, while walking, there is
always the possibility of running into a giraffe! Kennedy spotted it first and whispered to us to stay
absolutely silent and later added &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a giraffe&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t have to ask him
&ldquo;where&rdquo;, because before I could do that, not more than two hundred metres from us,
was this tall creature, peacefully grazing without noticing our presence, or
rather, not minding us as we probably did not seem to be a threat. The thrill
of spotting wild animals on a hike far exceeds spotting one from the safety
of a vehicle. I squinted and lifted my head to see its face as it was towered
above us. Slowly and gently, without any alarm, before we realized, it drifted
away to a safer distance behind the hillock somewhere. I had anticipated I would
encounter some smaller animals but little did I expect to come face-to-face or rather,
face-to-legs with a giraffe. This experience gave me fresh vigour to climb the hillock.</p>
<p>After the gently tapering initial section we were soon gaining ground quickly. It
wasn&rsquo;t going to be a climb to exhilarating heights, that I was sure of, but then
again, in relative terms, the land around was flat, so I was in anticipation of
good views nevertheless. Jackson was
leading the show and seemed to be in no mood for chit chats although Kennedy
was trying to bridge the gap by constantly speaking to us about the possibility
of seeing this or that, none of which bore fruition. He&rsquo;d also at times ask
Jackson something as if he needed his approval before presenting it to us, perhaps
in an attempt to make him participate a little more. As we climbed the hillock
I realized that the sun was quite harsh and even the seemingly dry and bony
looking Acacia clumps in good density at lower ground were good protection
up until then.</p>
<p>Our ascent was to conclude at a little clearing about one-thirds up the hillock.
One or two large rocks jutted out forming an overhanging over which we could
sit hanging our legs out into the wind. Jackson was the first one to do that
as if to hint what we all were supposed to do next. I asked him if he could show
us where his home was and he pointed in the general direction of the village
and I acknowledged. Everyone likes to step away from their homes a little and
spot it from far away; the excitement seems intrinsic to us. That is why the
world got so excited at the photograph of our planet when it was taken from
outer space. I guess it makes us appreciate home better.</p>
<p>A lot more landscape was visible at this point. Kennedy
pointed at many sections, far out beyond what I could register and he named names;
names of Conservancies and Resorts and villages that I had not heard of before.
We all chatted quite a bit. At this point both Kennedy and Jackson were also
chatting to each other in their local language with Jackson now having lost his
initial shy nature. He was the one who pointed at a tall looking tree down
below and said something about drinking. When I indicated that I did not get
what he said,he replied that we would pass by it during the return hike. I was busy taking some
pictures of the Maara, all of which came out hazy. The eyes were as usual a
better tool to have and nurture. The flat, dusty African landscape was not something
that could be fit into a rectangle with defined aspect ratios. There was more
to it; the sun, the breeze, the language of the Masai and the perpetual feeling
that a lion could jump at us from the nearby shrubbery.</p>
<p>As we descended the hillock later, Kennedy was the one leading this time and as
promised we were at the foot of a large tree, the only one of its kind in the
neighbourhood. It was called the Marula and Kennedy picked up a rotten reminder
of it from the floor below. It did not look like anything to me at that point
mainly due to the fact that it had fallen long ago. He explained that they used
it to make an alcoholic beverage and that it was very potent. As if to substantiate
this with clarity, he said &ldquo;100 times beer&rdquo;, at which point I laughed out loud
and acknowledged the seeming seriousness of it. Despite the fruit and its legends
the tree itself had an unnaturally large crown in comparison to the dwarfs around
it and was photogenic to look at. We moved on after I took some pictures.</p>
<p>Kennedy and Jackson had gotten very chatty now and were walking ahead and two
of us trudged along behind. The dirt track was now leading us out into the plains
and most importantly into a village. The prominent building of the village was
about four times the size of the other buildings. Before either of us bothered
to inquire about it, Kennedy had paused his local conversation, stopped and
was shouting out that it was the only school in the area. But he also said
something more which at first I did not hear very clearly. It became apparent
when one of the kids who were playing football in the school ground came running
towards him and Kennedy held him by the shoulder and said it again. It was his
son and he studied at the same school. The boy was about 10 years old and was
scanning us curiously. He wore a school uniform over which he had put on a thick
sweater which could only have been mandated because it wasn&rsquo;t that cold at all.
Later, after our introductions, I recollected what he was saying, that his son&rsquo;s
name was Obama; not because Obama is a local name from these parts, but because
he was named after the President of USA.</p>
<p>Jackson added to the descriptions by pointing out a local hospital and a church.
It was evidently a small village with very little going on apart from the major
activity being the tourism brought in by the resorts. As the boy ran away to
his friends and we started walking back towards the gate of Maara Xplorers I
inquired with Kennedy and Jackson about other kids. He said he also had a
daughter who wasn&rsquo;t at school today. Jackson replied that he had two sons. I
was curious about his beads and asked him where they got their colourful beads
for their jewellery? He replied &ldquo;from the coast&rdquo;. I did not probe further as soon
enough, we were all back at the gates of the resort. It was time to part ways;
at least with Jackson because we were only scheduled to meet him for this little
hike. I remembered my promise and asked him his native name. &ldquo;Something Ole Kisir,&rdquo;
he said. I regret not catching the first part because all I know now is that
