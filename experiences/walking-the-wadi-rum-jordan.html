					<p>How far would one have to drive out to actually get somewhere? Strange were
my thoughts as I stared out of the SUV into the emptiness all around.
Did we really have to get anywhere at all? In a desert like Wadi Rum it
took only an hour worth of driving to get
to a point where one&rsquo;s source and destination started to look the same
and considering we did not have any specific goal it was only logical
to rely on our host who was intently driving onwards on a trail that
could not have been older than a week. I could see the dust
cloud raised from our own vehicle had already gotten to the task of
covering the tire track we would have left behind.</p>
<p>When I looked out of the rear window it became clear why this place had
a magnetic effect on tourists. The settlement where we had met our host
a few minutes earlier was slowly fading away in the background, diffused
by the sand below and almost eaten up by the mountains on either side
that simply jutted out of a large bed of sand. It wasn&rsquo;t a wonder that
while the movie &ldquo;Lawrence of Arabia&rdquo; introduced this place to most of the
world, recent movies such as &ldquo;The Martian&rdquo; chose it as a location for
its depiction of the red planet. If I ignored the earthly groceries that
I could spot in the boot at the peripheries of my vision, I might as well
have been on a trip to the Martian surface.</p>
<p>We had signed up for a two days and two nights in the desert with tenting
and driving around and hopefully avoiding the many other tourists and camps
that were scattered around the Wadi. Our first little excursion today
was in fact by foot, near the settlement itself (known as the Wadi Rum
Village) while we waited for our host to sort out the plans for the next
two days. Around half a kilometre from the village and quite visible from
there is the Nabatean Temple, or to put it precisely the ruins of a
Nabatean Temple. Nabateans are an ancient Arabic Tribe who settled down
in Jordan, Syria and even Saudi Arabia and Palestine. At a time when their empire
flourished, Petra was their capital. The temple was not much to look at
and although it is considered that it was colourful, today its ruins
blend into the reddish orange backdrop. We spent a few minutes at the
location, almost directionless as we did not have the necessary guides
to understand the significance or history of the place.</p>

<p>When we returned to the village, the SUV that was to take us around for
the next few days was loaded and ready. We were asked to load our personal
belongings including the tents and then we were off. And here we were
now exiting what seemed to be a large corridor, the other end of which
was now completely invisible. The corridor opened up to a sea of sand
but that is not where we were headed to. This we got to know because
our host turned a right and then seemed to be driving towards a lone
tree that stood at the foothill of another mountain. With no other vegetation
around, the shade of the tree seemed like a camp for many others, mostly
other guides with their vehicles parked nearby. A lone camel herder
was hanging around too with the camels filling in the gaps between
the parked vehicles.</p>
<p>Our guide pointed in the direction of the crumbly and rock-strewn
mountain nearby and asked us to hike independently. He assured us that
some tea would be ready on our return. Originally and
locally known as &ldquo;Ain Abu Aineh&rdquo; and today known as &ldquo;Lawrence&rsquo;s Spring&rdquo;
it is the only water source for miles around and has historically
served caravans as it serves camel groups today. A short trek up the
rubble and rock takes one to the source of the spring which cannot be
missed due to the only green spots that line its flow all the way to
the base. Since our trip was in summer, the spring had dried down to
a thin stream. Not feeling brave enough to actually drink the water
I walked further north instead towards a rock that could be used as
a resting point.</p>
<p>The views were spectacular. And considering these were the first aerial
views of Wadi Rum we were getting, I was excited. Down below, the
camels were still parked and their guardians were sitting around steaming
kettles of tea and chatting away. Far ahead in the distance, someone
was already leading a caravan of camels out into the nothingness. Closer
below at the foothills, coloured dots decorated the otherwise uniform
cream, brown and maroon. Some dots were moving faster than the others.
Tourists like us climbing up to the spring. Looking up at the sky,
we found the Sun slowly preparing itself for baking us all in this large
oven and considering that we had started early to avoid this experience
we hurried back down towards our guide. The idea of hot tea even if under
the shade of a tree was not very enticing. But if the Bedouin have
been doing it for long there must be something to it.</p>

<p>Language was a big barrier. We did not speak even a little Arabic other
than the word &ldquo;Shukhran&rdquo; which I profusely used when the tea was
handed over to me. Thankfully I could converse with our guide in some
English while the other guides and herders spoke only Arabic with
each other and our guide. Only basic pleasantries were exchanged and
before I could gulp down the extremely sweet tea, our guide had already
started packing the wares and hinting that we move on. It was our fault
really. As per the norms around here, we were offered the usual fare
of hanging out in a desert camp somewhere, listen to some songs and
perhaps watch a dance performance while enjoying the Bedouin culinary
experience. But we had insisted on what we called &ldquo;the real thing&rdquo;.
We had asked for hikes through the Wadi and tenting and cooking out
in the open. Now our guide was basically hinting that chilling under
the shade goes against this premise. So we gladly complied.</p>
<p>As we drove out of this little green corner I could see that the landscape
opened up. There were trails everywhere and in all directions; both tire
tracks as well as camel tracks. But nothing at all in sight. Up ahead
I saw copious amounts of sand. It was a sand dune and we were driving
towards it. Reddish in colour and sending out waves of heat that could
be felt by anyone who sensed that something was up, especially since
our guide slowed down and found a nice shady spot under the natural
caves and cuts of a nearby mountain facing the dune. In about five minutes
we were out there hiking up the dune while our guide took a short nap.
The plan was to walk up the dune and enjoy the process as well as the
scenery from the summit.</p>
<p>Anyone who has walked on sand knows how tough it can be. And it got
only tougher on an incline. Add to that the soaring temperatures and
I was tired even before starting. Yet, this was an extremely invigorating experience. Out
came our scarves and headgear to protect ourselves from the harsh sun
and also sunglasses as by now both the heat and the light were getting
to us. Thankfully there wasn&rsquo;t any harsh winds or sand storms. It was
a quiet afternoon in that sense and we were already getting used to the
drill. Far ahead I could see another SUV drive past in the valley, like a
little toy car. It is only sights like those that reminded me of the
size of the Wadi itself which can easily be misjudged from the photographs
we were clicking.</p>

<p>The descent from the dune was quick with playful slides and quick bouts
of running and yet again some tea waited for us. We chatted up a bit
about tea, sugar and trade with our guide who was the only one among us
who could lay claim to be a descendant of some of the greatest
history influencing traders of all time. The Levant as it is known
lies right in the centre of Africa, Europe and Asia and has seen not
just trade routes that influenced empires and changed history but also
has been the passing route of waves of human races who came out of
the African continent to spread to the rest of the planet. There was
much to talk about if we talked about the history of this place and how
tea and sugar managed to reach the desert was only the beginning of such
a story.</p>
<p>We drove to a spot next which we found was named &ldquo;Alameleh Inscriptions&rdquo;.
There were no signboards or information here apart from the fact that
our guide briefly explained to us that the petroglyphs were the creation
of the Nabateans or even people before them. The inscriptions looked
old enough and etched into many sections of the flat surfaces that
composed the mammoth mountain that we were looking at. It is not that
these inscriptions were at any particular location. They could be found
scattered all over Wadi Rum and even beyond. Our minimal understanding
of the matter and inability to interpret or understand them were the
only reason why we moved on after a few photographs. We were however
left impressed by the human effort itself. Especially our ability to
tell stories because that is what these inscriptions were. Stories of
the lives of people who passed through and lived here thousands of
years ago.</p>
<p>Our guide meanwhile was scouting for a good spot for lunch and turning the
corner, I found him nearby setting up the stove already. Lunch was a simple
affair over a high-pressure cooking fuel driven stove, some traditional
bread that was re-heated and canned beans with tomato sauce. Probably it would
have been a more elaborate affair if we weren&rsquo;t vegans. Our seemingly weird
dietary choice had left our guide confused and he had decided at the beginning
of the journey that it would be best to take us to a grocery store and buy
whatever we could eat. That made it simple, as we could identify canned food
and bread without much effort. Tired as we
were, we gorged on the stuff and welcomed the suggestion of a nap. The
short nap lasted for about 3 hours and this phenomenon can only be
understood and appreciated by someone who has indulged in short naps
on an extremely hot day under a rapid ceiling fan. When we woke up, it
was yet again time for another tea, the third one during our trip. And
off we were sent on yet another hike.</p>

<p>This time our guide decided to unhinge us a bit more and gave us
theoretical instructions based on natural formations in the far distance.
Unused though we were to such instructions, we managed to grasp the
simplicity of it. I mean, one has to be really unlucky to miss a simple
instruction such as walk towards &ldquo;that rock jutting out&rdquo; and then
take a right and then walk towards &ldquo;that mountain&rdquo;. There weren&rsquo;t that
many things jutting out and then there weren&rsquo;t people or noises or
other distractions. So we took off on a long walk to experience the
desert like conditions. This time the ground was more of gravel and
thorny shrubs and this was a novelty. The walk was long and arduous and
at one point the distance from where we started from and &ldquo;that rock
jutting out&rdquo; started to look exactly the same and exactly how it was
when we began. Nevertheless, after pushing ourselves we were at the
end of the walk and had experienced quite a bit of the harshness that
the desert offered. Thankfully we were walking on the eastern side of
a mountain and the setting sun meant that the eastern sides were much
cooler. One only has to step out from sun into the shades of the mountains
to witness the difference in temperature that was on offer. We were met at the
end by our smiling guide who had driven there via another route
and setup camp for the night. &ldquo;That is it for today&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>Evening was spent setting up our tent and some short walks and photography.
The place turned into a beautiful orange, red and blue and presented
us with views that were out of this world. Our guide was busy preparing
dinner though. Since lunch was a makeshift affair he had decided for
dinner to be slightly better. So a proper fire was setup with collected
wood and a few more items were on the menu; an extra side dish with fresh
vegetables and some rice. Tea was there as well both as an appetizer
as well as an aperitif. While we all sat down and had dinner, the sun
had moved onto the other magical lands in the west and the sky was
now full of stars. It was unlike any recent starry nights that I had
experienced. Deserts tend to be the best places for stargazing and Wadi
Rum is no exception. But it wasn&rsquo;t about the kind of place. It was also
about where exactly we were. Long before any kind of man had looked up
at the stars and wondered about ourselves, the men here had. Finding
our smallness, sources and destinies in the stars goes a long way back
for the Arab cultures and to sit at that specific spot and share some
of that wonder was an enriching experience. When we finally rested for
the night the desert was as cold as it was hot earlier.</p>
<p>The second day began with a simple breakfast of local bread and hummus.
With very little driving, we were dropped off at the mouth of yet
another formation that seemed like a monster with a red tongue made of a
sand dune. We were told that we had to hike up that dune and through the
canyon to arrive at the other end. As far as we understood the instructions
we could not get lost because to get out of this labyrinth one would
have to deliberately decide to do some rock climbing and avoid the obvious
trail which is a river of sand that extended for a few kilometres beyond
this monster&rsquo;s tongue. After having ascertained that we had understood
the instruction, our guide drove off in what seemed to be the opposite
direction. We started climbing up the first dune which after passing
through a narrow passageway opened up to a large bed of sand that was
flanked on both sides by the rocks and hills; a homogeneous texture
that curved to the left. With the knowledge that we could get lost only
if we wanted to, we were confident to stray a bit here and there.
Photography opportunities were plenty and so were the chances to sing out
loud because in some of the narrow sections where the walls on either
side were as high as fifty feet, the acoustical effect meant that anyone who could
hum a tune, felt like a singer. We spent a good part of the entire
morning session in this area before exiting it hopefully at the
designated section because at some point we saw the familiar SUV drive
towards us. We never asked if he found us where he expected.</p>

<p>After lunch and a short nap - this time really short - it was decided
that we would be heading over to a place known as &ldquo;Mushroom Rock&rdquo; and
true to its name it was to be in the shape of a mushroom where the
softer base of the rock had eroded over a period of time leaving the
harder sections on the top making it look like as if someone had placed
a very large bulbous rock on a tiny pedestal. Our visit to this place
also happened to be the first time we ran into other tourists and
perhaps it was also the time of the day which invited many others here.
It was interesting to note that this phenomenon had affected just one
piece of rock here which made it a bit of a loner but a star attraction
and a photo opportunity.</p>
<p>The sun was heading west again and our guide reminded us that for a
logically complete trip of the Wadi Rum we would have to visit one of
the sunset points that he had chosen for us. But since we had a few
more hours before that we could afford one more trek, this time through
the &ldquo;Burrah Canyon&rdquo;. This canyon has historically been fertile and has
been used for growing crops in the past. There is also an old dam like
structure built of stones from the Nabatean era at the narrowest end of
the canyon towards the south. After dropping us at the northern point
our guide drove of to the southern end where he said he would wait for
us to take us to the next location. The instructions given to us were
according to the confidence shown by us in previous short treks. But as
luck had to be, this time we could not keep up to them.</p>
<p>After walking for about an hour we found ourselves lost. The reason was
simply because we did not grasp that we had to actually climb over the
rocks that made up the dam and thought what we saw in front of
us to be the wrong way and detoured to find other routes and then
failed repeatedly. This process of discovery ensured that we lost a lot
of time until we figured that all we had to do was climb to a slightly
higher altitude to find the way out of the canyon. Once that was actually
understood, it took less than half an hour to find an opening to the
south where the canyon opened up again into a large sandy valley where
in the distance our impatient guide was waiting for us. Almost as soon
as we had stepped back into the vehicle he was driving us to the next
tea-stop which also happened to be the last attraction that we would
visit before heading to the sunset point.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Umm Frouth Rock Bridge&rdquo; as it was called is yet another natural
formation where time and elements have eroded to create a bridge like
structure and the adventurous ones get to climb atop the same. While
my sense of adventure persisted, I lacked the time to do the same. So
plans to actually attempt a climb were aborted and instead we had to
take solace in enjoying the view itself and some photographs. As the
sunlight waned the rock bridge formed shadows on the sandy floor while
our guide, who tracked this hurriedly prepared some tea for us, all
the while chatting with a compatriot who was guiding another team. I
meanwhile enjoyed the last few moments of light and wonder that was
the Wadi Rum and started saying our goodbyes. But not yet. We did not
have to do it here. There was the actual sunset point, our guide
reminded us and packed us all back into his vehicle and took us there.</p>
<p>Suddenly it felt as if we had entered the most touristy spots in the
area. There were many vehicles parked under a large mountain, the
west face of which had enough platforms at different heights where
people could simply sit and watch the sun set in the distance. Many
tourists had already picked their spots. Most of them perhaps going
through their silent moments of solitude after spending a wonderful
day in this desert. We found a little corner as well while the guide
who had seen it all innumerable times instead chose to catch up with
his friends at the base of the mountain. Sitting with my back against
the warm rock I ran through the events of the day in my head while
watching the sun set over the mountains in the distance. The redness
of the setting sun was redder than ever thanks to the terrain that
reflected the same colour. Chameleons scurried across to the safety of
their little dens for the night. Camels yawned out of sheer boredom
below while the herders sat down and rested after yet another day. In
about 15 minutes it was dark again and our guide escorted us back to
the vehicle and took us to a new spot he had chosen for tenting.</p>

<p>This time we pitched our tents in the dark and it was an effort because
we had chosen a corner without much of a wind-breaker. But we managed
to put it up in good time and ascertain its stability. The spot itself
was excellent again for star gazing and stepping away from the tent,
to see it from a distance with the stars in the backdrop was a surreal
sight. However, to know that this would be the last night in the desert
dampened my spirits. What was needed was some warmth to bring up the
mood and that was provided by our enthusiastic guide who had again
cooked up a nice meal that this time we enjoyed it sitting inside a cave. The
firewood cooked meal, the fire itself and the cave setting was the
perfect ending for our two days of exploring the Wadi Rum, the largest
desert in Jordan. While we again chatted away with our guide and host
about his country and culture in the limited language we shared we
wondered what we had missed visiting. Perhaps another visit another
time I thought. But till then, this will do.</p>
