					<p>The notorious reputation of
Matatus that I had gathered from various forums preceded their appearance.
This made me look at each of them with horror, like they were assassins. When
I saw them while crossing the street, I would jump and step back, holding
my partner&rsquo;s hand tightly, with my eyes shut, as though, they were on a mission
to kill; as if they would, at any time, veer off the road, into the footpath and
run me over. So, I was not in my best of spirits when I realized that I had no
other option than to finally board one to Narok. We walked with our backpacks
through the busy lanes of River Road, where the streets were overflowing with
Matatus of various sizes, shapes and colours and we were followed by &ldquo;agents&rdquo;
who would be tasked with luring us to their bus company, for a small commission.
Young men sold us stuff that was readily available in any shop nearby, some
pulled us to the side to speak to us discreetly, giving us the creeps, in their
seemingly harmless attempt at selling us tickets to some place we didn&rsquo;t want
to go to. I felt the need to clutch my valuables close to my chest as I started
suspecting that some of them were to rob us. But, when I saw all of this from a distance,
what seemed scary at first, turned into sadness, as I stood in the middle
of all the action. What I saw was unemployment, wasted youth and poverty.
Young men towering over me, who appeared threatening at first, when our eyes
met, seemed sad, vulnerable and uncertain. I eased out, smiled at them,
politely refused whatever they were trying to sell and slowly made my way
towards the ticket counter of the destination that we had to go to - Narok.
Narok was still the intermediate point, but the farthest point on our route
to which we could get a Matatu to from this place.</p>
<p>Once we bought the tickets and took the last row seats in the Matatu,
it did not feel as scary as seeing one from the outside. Slowly, the Matatu
filled to its full capacity, and a little more, and to my shock, a lot more,
to the point that people were pretending to be seated! I was lodged in the last
row, with my partner on one side and a window on the other, as
though in a straight-jacket. After about half an hour of waiting, we were on
the move. I could finally relax once we left the busy streets of Nairobi
and were on the highway very soon. I looked forward
to seeing the great rift valley that would appear after about an hour of
journey. We met a friendly local named Kevin, who worked at Nairobi but was travelling
to his home-town. I was assured to find some polite, trustable, friendly and most
importantly, English speaking company on our maiden Matatu journey.</p>
<p>Being in an African countryside for the first time, I started enjoying the trip.
The landscapes on either side of the highway was breathtaking, vast stretches
of hills and undulating land, a scale that was hard for me to imagine at first.
The East African Rift that to splits the continent into two parts has been widening
at a leisurely pace and will take another 10 million years before achieving this task.
I noticed that the viewpoints around the rift were filled with locals, probably from cities
like Nairobi, since it apparently was a picturesque recreational spot.</p>
<p>After what seemed like an hour, we could see smoke inside the Matatu
in one of the front seats and people started screaming. I was terrified, being
sandwiched right at the back of the vehicle, with absolutely no escape. Kevin calmly
explained to us that there was a fire! I panicked, tried to move out of my seat.
He told me that it was nothing serious, and it was best not to leave my seat.
I was assured by his calm and confident advice. After a few
minutes, the Matatu stopped and the driver came to inspect. There indeed seemed
to be a small fire, which he quickly put out. Everyone in the front row got out and sat at the side of
the road. We stayed on for a while inside itself, hoping of getting transferred to
another Matatu However, after about fifteen minutes, after the driver poured a
can of water on the heated part, and declared that we were ready to leave, I was
surprised, but soon realized that he was not joking. People who had left their
seats came back to find that it was taken and a fight ensued. Finally everyone settled
down and we moved on!</p>

<p>After another hour, when the Matatu, for a second time in a row showed
signs of a breakdown, all of us stayed put and gave the
engine some rest, after which it just started and we moved on. By about lunchtime,
we reached a crowded area, the Narok Matatu stand, with dust all around and numerous
Matatus parked. As our Matatu eased into this stand, we were swarmed by hawkers
selling everything from water to watches. A mosque in the middle of this market
cum Matatu stand announced the noon prayer call. There were several small shops
selling a lot of items, including food, but it was not easily distinguishable from
each other as they all seemed to take the same brown colour owing to a layer of
dust that had settled over them.</p>
<p>With Kevin&rsquo;s help, we easily located a Matatu (this time an old sedan)
that agreed to take us to Mara. We thanked him profusely as he parted ways.
As we sat in the back seat of the car waiting for two more co-passengers, the
&ldquo;agent&rdquo; we had spoken to came towards the car dragging another man along. He
made him sit in the front seat. We were relieved to know that we just had to wait
for one more passenger before we could continue our trip. To my surprise, two
girls walked towards the car, ushered by the &ldquo;agent&rdquo;. While I was wondering where
they would sit, my side of the door opened and they were both pushed in. So now,
there were four of us in the back seat, shuffling back and forth to make space.
Before we could finally leave, two more men were fetched and made to sit, one on
the passenger seat and another just next to the driver, sharing the driver&rsquo;s seat!
The driver, whom we had not seen anywhere near the car so far, took some money
from the agent and started driving. The voice of the woman selling us &ldquo;Maajhi-Soda-Baridi&rdquo;
echoed in my ear, her poignant look (I must have seen her about twenty times that afternoon
as she persisted with her sales) haunted me long after I left her there at the
Narok Matatu stand.</p>
