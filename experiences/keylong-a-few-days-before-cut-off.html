					<p>We were on our way down from Shasur Gompa. The Gompa visit was a self-guided tour
and hence it was limited to looking around at flags, murals and ubiquitous style
and architecture that we had seen before and making up our own stories and
assumptions. But I was sure we missed a lot. There must have been a larger history
and then a local history. There must have been some drama and a legend and a
myth. If so, all that remained untold to us as we were there only for about an
hour mostly enjoying the mountain breeze that made the flags flutter audibly
in this amphitheatre of sorts with tall ice-capped mountains surrounding us. The
valley below and the town it nestled was an amazing sight. The short visit to
the Gompa was perhaps a microcosm of our visit to Keylong itself. It had to be
short because supposedly the Rohtang Pass would close very soon and this part
of the world would be cut off from the rest of India. We were to take what we
get and take the long road South very soon.</p>
<p>This was before the Internet so completely caricatured life and travel. So, when
we ran into a middle-aged woman who crossed our path on that descending dirt
track, all of us extended the courteous smiles into conversations. Back then, we
could not pass by someone and later look for information on them online. Split
second decisions were taken and mental maps redrawn. Before we knew it, she had
invited us to her home which apparently was uphill again via another route. We
only had chai and biscuit waiting for us down at our hotel and a return journey
the next day as promised by the conductor of the last bus for the season. It wasn&rsquo;t
exactly a hard choice. She was offering us more than impersonal beverages so I
was excited about the prospect. We chatted a lot as we walked along with her
closely following her footsteps as it navigated the hill deftly. She  made it clear
that Keylong was her world now; it was even before she married and settled at her
present home. She was born in the next village.</p>
<p>I felt privileged to enter her home. It was the first time for me to be entering
a manifestation of the idea of a home that was completely different from what
I had seen up until then in photographs from travel books. Or perhaps I had not
yet read the books that I have read now. My unaccustomed eyes found it hard to
distinguish what made it stand out from some of the aesthetics and motifs I had
just seen at the Gompa. The room - the only room we were invited to - was a low
roofed square structure with a bench that ran its perimeter with coloured
cushioning that was predominantly red. There was a mosaic of carpets on the
floor and right in the centre was the Choolha; it was also the first time I was
being introduced to the system, so she explained it to us while she boiled some
water for the tea. We sat down on the carpet, borrowing some cushions. She spoke
about how, just in a few days the roads would close and people would stop
travelling. There would be snow everywhere. I inquired about how she would survive
and she said all that they produced in the last season would  be stored away
and used through this season. She pointed at the upper part of the walls. Closed
shelves ran in parallel to the bench below. I understood that it contained hardy
vegetables like Potatoes, Cabbages and Cauliflowers. I remember sitting there
thinking about the weeks after we were gone when all that she said would be
reality and year in and year out. There was something about being imprisoned
like that by our own lives, conditioning and places we are born. There was also
something about being not imprisoned, well, at least at Keylong. I felt a terrible
urge to live her life and offer her mine, if only as a temporary trade. At the
same time, why? I asked myself. What I understand now is that it was important
to know and meet her at that point. So much of my travels in later life was
shaped by what was learnt in that brief encounter.</p>

<p>I was still holding my tea and sipping it as we walked outside in her vegetable
garden and she spoke about the things they were growing around the house. It
was a small plot but the whole setting was mesmerizing. I could have been deceived
by the cover provided by vegetation or the excitement of the moment, but it looked
like she lived quite far away from the nearest neighbour. On one side was a
viewpoint from where the scenery was exactly the same as it was from the Gompa.
I had already learnt that while travelling in these parts. The life, represented
by the composition inside the frames of a photograph seemed to mimic real life
itself; nothing changed or went out of place for very long durations and
distances. I was sure I could return here and the place would look the same
years later but I could only hope that I was right. Decades after my visit, the
Rohtang pass does not close now thanks to a tunnel that was bored through the
mountains. The tea in my hands went cold abruptly as a reminder that it was
getting closer to sundown.</p>
<p>When we progressed from the dirt track to the cobblestoned streets, I knew we
had descended enough to call ourself close to The Chandrabhaaga, the hotel
where we were put up. We were in the peripheries of the town as indicated by
the rows of houses that emerged as we turned a corner. A little boy who was
being bathed clean by his mother stared at us doubtfully. His doubts turned
to a shy smile when we waved. The mother waved back too. The structure that
separated their home from the street was a long running compound wall made only
of stacked wood; not neatly organized cut wood, but what seemed like foraged
or driftwood. At first it glance it did not even look like a wall but just a
very long and snaking stack of firewood. The houses themselves employed construction
techniques that were completely alien to me then, and is perhaps still quite
incomprehensible now due to a lack of attention from my part. But even within
Keylong, as the village streets merged into the better roads down below, the
building styles changed to more pukka houses and buildings. Our hotel itself
was testimony to this fact because it was a rather large and pompous one and
stood out among the other buildings.</p>
<p>That same evening, while sitting in the room which had a 180 degree view of
the mountains around, I contemplated the idea of leaving Keylong after what
seemed like an incomplete and only mildly satisfying visit. There was certainly
much more to see and I would miss it all because I landed here very late. I
inspected the little piece of paper in which our friendly lady had
written her address. In fact it wasn&rsquo;t even her address, as such. It was her
husband&rsquo;s name and the name of the post-office. She assured us that we only
had to send it there and it would reach her. We had taken a photograph together
and I fully intended to print and post it to her at that address. The young man
who was our main contact since we arrived the previous day arrived at our door
and announced dinner.</p>
<p>As we sat in the dining area of the hotel, enjoying a simple meal, it was
extremely dark outside; most importantly very cold. The darkness hid away all
the beauty that Keylong is situated amidst and far diminished the world-view for
now. It was mainly the bright lights of our hotel and a few more down the
street. But darkness also meant that the stars were up and about. It was a
moonless night and hence the silhouettes of the upper walls of the amphitheatre
were barely visible; ridges of mountains, as though a continuous line that
I could trace when I traced it all around. Somewhere in the north were some
of the larger mountains as technically we were still not among the big players.
The road north of Keylong led to Leh-Ladakh. In fact, the bus in which we were
supposed to return was on its last trip from there, taking people down to the
comparatively warmer town of Manali and beyond. I sat outside just for a few
more minutes enjoying the night sky before common sense and biting cold forced
me back into my warm spot for the night. In just a couple of days after we left,
entire villages, especially businesses and shops would close down and most of
the people would migrate, southbound to warmer climates. But a few would stay
put, like the kind lady we met, going about their regular but restricted lives
right through the freezing winter, with meagre but carefully accumulated
supplies and firewood, the same way that they have lived year after year and
the same way that their ancestors had lived for centuries.</p>
