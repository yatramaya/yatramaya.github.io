					<p>Before travelling to East Africa, I had managed my travels with two grand assumptions (a) long distances are better covered by night (b) if you are ready to pay a price, there are better options in public transport. While these two were busted pretty quickly, none of my experiences so far had prepared me for a “matatu”.</p>
<p>From whatever I had read earlier, before landing in Kenya, I had deduced that all my travels had to be done during the day. Night travel was not recommended; even locals would hesitate and think twice before travelling through the night. It was considered unsafe. I cannot really say whether it is true or not because I did not feel adventurous, or rather, brave enough to give it a try; to test this. I just took their word for it. Several travellers who have come here before me, who have taken pains to try things out and write about it, deserved their respect. This also meant that most of my days spent in Africa would have to be invested in just travelling from one place to another. Now considering Africa is a large land mass, even travelling through only the East of Africa took a lot of time. And, of course, this applies to people like me who have decided to use the roadways (and not fly from point A to B). Most of East Africa has very poor railway system, hence I had to reduce my options to road. Since I was backpacking, I had to rely on their public transport system. A distance of about 100 kms can frustratingly take about half a day to cover, sometimes more, if the trip involves multiple transfers. This makes travel highly inefficient.</p>
<p>This is when I started reading about something called a “Matatu”. An interesting name, you might think. I had read about horror stories about matatus — their overloading, breakdowns, accidents and extremely unpredictable time. By the time I left to East Africa, I had started fearing these creatures and was hesitant to approach them. Like crocodiles in a river — you know they are around, you just don’t want to encounter one. It is exotic to talk about and read about it, but somehow you wouldn’t want to get too close to one. So, by the time I landed in Nairobi, I just took a private taxi and reached the hotel. On the way, like a tourist seeing animals in a zoo, I saw matatus from the safety of my taxi window. They came in various colours and shapes — with almost always some loud music playing. It appeared flamboyant; each matatu displaying an attitude. Messages, Philosophy, Slogans that would put a humble auto rickshaw driver back home to shame, were blaring as loud as their music. And they drove like they were the only ones on the road. They hardly applied brakes and rarely slowed down for traffic; sometimes taking on vehicles head on by driving on the wrong side of the road. They would be flying at full speed (the full speed these vehicles are capable of, which is thankfully not very high) and would suddenly swerve to the left and come to an abrupt hard stop on seeing potential passengers. Then take off again without a warning. They were all over the road, several of them. Almost all of them were packed with people. None of these poor souls sitting inside shared any excitement or attitude that the vehicle outwardly proclaimed. From outside, overall, it looked like a scary proposition. So, the first two days I stalled getting into one, willing to walk great distances to explore the city.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I desperately searched for ways to reach my next destination, Narok, hoping to find some alternative trasport to Matatus. But there was none. Then the day came when I had to board this beast. It happened very quickly — buying ticket and getting herded into one. And then, suddenly I was inside a half filled matatu. Initially it didn’t seem so bad and I got a window seat also, albeit in the last row. Then started the long wait for the matatus to get filled. There is no fixed departure time as there are no expectations on the arrival time at destination also. Everyone indefinitely sits and waits hoping that the matatu fills. And sometimes, when we feel that it is full, the driver sets off only to stop about a hundred metres later to again fish for some passengers. Sometimes we see a matatu with a couple of people already sitting inside and board it. After waiting for several minutes, when the matatu is about to leave after gathering enough critical mass, the two people who had sat from the start get down and walk away. They were just sitting like “bait” to lure people. They were not passengers. This was their way to make a quick buck (or rather slow, depending on their luck).</p>
<p>There is a “conductor” who keeps waving at people randomly calling out to anyone passing by asking if they would like to come. Whether they are planning to go in that direction or they even wanted to travel or showed any inclination to look for a matatu does not matter to them. Sometimes it looks like the conductor is flirting with some passerby as we can see her blushing and nodding her head shyly. This process continues almost the entire duration of the trip, stopping often, suddenly and picking up people. Sometimes they look like they don’t want to board but they are forced to as the conductor has already shoved their luggage into the matatu. And, there are annoying times when it stops in front of prospective passengers and they in turn take their time, inspect the matatu, peep in, look around and finally say “yes” as if they are female birds inspecting a nest built by her mate. I wonder what they look for because not once did I see them complain or refuse. They simply squeeze into it meekly. And just when you begin to wonder where is the space for more people, there is a readjustment, pushing of people, rearranging and space gets magically created. At every stop, you can expect certain rearrangements and none of this is remotely in your control. You are just luggage; things that need to be transported. And they will decide how and when to transport you.</p>
<p>Matatu conductors probably see passengers as bags that need to be lugged along for a price, so can be traded with other matatus whenever they see benefit of doing so. So when you are travelling in a matatu, it is never certain (to anybody) that you would go the entire distance in the same vehicle. Most often, you could be asked to get down and move into another matatu with no regard whatsoever to your feelings (or intent). There would be no explanation. Just that someone will open the boot, drag your bag outside and then ask you to get down. Before you get a chance to comprehend what is happening, you would be herded into another matatu (sometimes asked to get out of a bus and board a matatu). Of course, you wouldn’t need to pay extra because they have struck a deal between the two drivers and they would have paid you off. Since all this happens without any warning or plan and sometimes without much explanation, all you can do is meekly comply and hope that your eviction is ultimately beneficial for everyone.</p>

<p>When the matatu finally was full, I counted 22 people (included 2 children who were generally shifted and shoved wherever necessary) + driver where the capacity was 14 passengers! There are people sitting sometimes in the gap between two seats. All this seemed uncomfortable when seen externally. But once you are in the middle of the action, you submit. To divine providence. Like one matatu’s message that said “Keep Calm and Trust God”. This is probably the mantra they religiously follow. Since the fare is mostly shared by the number of people inside, the people don’t seem to mind the overcrowding.</p>
<p>So it set off in “full speed” and I was relived at the wind entering and giving some relief from the stink and sweat. Once it starts moving, and you are inside one, a matatu does not seem so bad, afterall. After about an hour of driving smoothly, in the midst of which I even managed to get some sleep, surprisingly, there was some smoke coming out of the vehicle. I was shocked to see this and panicked, trying to jump out of the door. But everyone else seemed calm and were only slightly inconvenienced by this. Nobody panicked or tried to alight the vehicle. The driver stopped after a while and asked some people to get off. I grabbed my bag and jumped out. I was trying to understand what was happening when a nice man who was seated next to me all the while explained in simple English that there was a fire. The driver and the conductor tried to extinguish it and after a while someone from a nearby matatu (that had stopped seeing our plight) came with a fire extinguisher and they sprayed it on the underside of the vehicle. Soon, everyone, having got their much needed break, got back into their seats and we went ahead as if none of this affected us.</p>
<p>Another time, in the very next matatu that I traveled in, something very similar happened in about the same time after engine was running. There was a hissing sound and the conductor said the engine was overheated and had to pour water on in (and inside the radiator). I wondered why they wouldn’t fill it up with water before leaving, if they knew it would run out of water? Why did they have to wait till it actually happened? This was something I failed to understand. But again, everyone alighted the vehicle and spent about half an hour on the roadside before the problem was “resolved” and we continued. In between another matatu stopped by. My understanding was that we would be transferred to it. But he just expressed his sympathies and drove away. Somehow, after these two experiences (that were coincidentally subsequent), I started feeling that almost always a matatu would break down after about an hour or two of running continuously, which might not really be far from the truth. And, no two matatu rides are similar. There is always some new, unexpected adventure that will be thrown in.</p>

<p>The only time a matatu starts feeling like a much better bargain is when you get into a shared taxi. This is basically an old, run down five seater sedan, either owned by an individual or a group of friends. Before experiencing one of these, I used to be proud of Indians who are known for “Jugaad” where they have the talent to fit up to six people in a maruti 800. But here I was taken by surprise and to my horror had to travel in a sedan which had 8 people and the driver wanting to include more. The first time I sat in one, it was empty, so I thought it was better than a matatu because two of us travelling only had to wait for two more passengers before we set off. So, we sat in the back seat, waiting. After a while they “fished” one passenger, who sat in the front seat. Then the back door opened and another woman was shoved next to us. So now we were three people in the back seat, was getting cosy now. This is when the backdoor on the other side opened and another person was shoved in. We didn’t think he would fit in really, but somehow everyone sat on each other and the door was shut. Now, we thought, we could leave. But then again, one guy was made to sit in the driver’s seat and I was almost sure that he was not the driver. This is when the driver arrived from nowhere and pushed the guy further in (to lodge him between the two front seats) and sat in the driver’s seat and finally we were off. The whole journey I sat as though in a straight-jacket. I was almost certain that this was the maximum a sedan could take.</p>
<p>But I was proved wrong again on another trip when we were comfortably travelling with 4 passengers and suddenly were stopped by four people on two bikes (it seemed like the bikes broke down or they were asking for a ride). Now I counted and deduced, from my limited understanding of such dynamics, that we could pick up a max of two more people. But, we were asked to alight and move to the front seat. And three new people were shoved in the backseat. Now as I was wondering where the passenger in the front seat went, he suddenly appeared from the driver’s side of the front door and sat in the driver’s seat. The driver soon sat next to him and closed the door. And now were were 4 people in the front and 4 in the backseat. And, the driver had to change gears across the other guy’s legs each time and to me this was hilarious. Now that we knew we had no reason to stop, I could see another single guy on the road signalling the taxi to stop. I was sure that the only place that he might fit in was inside the boot or on top of the car. But to my (and the collective) astonishment, the driver stops and decides to take him in. He opens the boot, put his luggage inside and opens the backdoor! Just as he was asking the new guy to somehow fit inside, a fight started between the driver and one of the passengers. Finally with the driver showering abuses, the passenger’s argument won and the new guy was unceremoniously left on the road and we continued.</p>

<p>There were times when there would be police checks on matatus to report over-crowding. An official peeps into the vehicle and looks around. From my assessment, they are only asked to check if all are seated. In a van, where it is impossible to stand while it is moving, I have seen on certain legs of the trip, people standing with their heads sideways. And, once all the fixed seats on the matatu are filled up (over-filled, rather), there are some mobile seats, like overturned wooden boxes, a plank of wood piece placed as a bridge between two adjacent seats, which are also considered as seats. So, if someone has to stand, it has to be after all these. When the matatu stopped for inspection, a couple of guys standing just pretended to sit, with their legs bent, as if there was a chair under them, propped in thin air. They held this position till the inspection was complete and then they stood up. In another case, a man was asked to just “sit” although it was clear to everyone that there was no seat. He “sat” in the gap between two adjacent seats (the gap that is left for people to walk to the behind row). He sat this way all through the journey without a complaint.</p>
<p>If you think, overcrowding and body aches are the only things you need to worry about in matatus, you are wrong. I realised, to my utter anger and frustration, that I had to worry about getting robbed of my backpack or its belongings too! After putting my backpack in the “boot”, which is basically the back door opening and a small sliver of space between the last seat and the backdoor used for luggage space, I thought I need not worry about it till I got down. But once I found that after I got down and went to collect my backpack, to my horror, it was opened up and some items were missing. I was fuming, but couldn’t do much. So the next time, I had to take extra care to pack slightly useless items on top (which is very difficult when you are only carrying exactly what you need) and fear each time that something will be opened. Worst even, I was not even sure if my entire backpack would get lost. This disturbed me a lot as at every stop, I had to try hard to turn my neck around and look if something is happening to my backpack, which is always not possible to even see due to the crowd. Sitting in the last row sometimes ensures that you are closer to the backpack and can watch out, but this is not always possible as you cannot choose where you sit.</p>

<p>The one incidence that really shook me was when we were travelling from Kakamega to Kisumu (in Kenya). We had boarded a matatu and was seated in the last row. Everything was looking normal (as normal as matatus can be from my experience so far) and I could see Kisumu town at a distance. We were about twenty minutes away from the city centre and were on a highway. We noticed a police patrol team was stopping vehicles for inspection ahead. This is when our driver decides to speed up and escapes from the police. He not only speeds up, he turns left into some narrow alleys driving around. We realise we are being chased by a police motorbike. I have so far only seen such chases from the outside, in films. But to my horror, I am stuck inside this vehicle which is not just off route now but driving rashly, tossing us around. I was terrified and feared for my life. The way he was driving I thought it is only a matter of time before he gets into an accident. At one point, he was driving at full speed into a child walking on the road. In the last moment, the child realises and runs for its life. This chase continued for about twenty minutes although it felt like two hours. I was sweating, screaming and praying. The rest of the passengers did not seem to be afraid. In fact, they were cheering him on, helping him escape by tracking the police vehicle and reporting real time. They seemed to enjoy this. Finally he manages to lose the police tail and he successfully drops us in the middle of nowhere, a maze of mud roads, without any explanation, throws out our luggage and leaves. We walk in some direction with help of GPS to find our way back to the highway. I was so shaken by this that I needed to rest for sometime before moving ahead. We then walked for about four kilometres, with our backpacks, on the highway and reached another matatu stand. At this point, I hated every matatu that I came across. But left with no choice, I had to pick one to continue my journey. Matatus have a strange way of turning you into a believer. Because, when you are inside one, the only thing that you can do is to Keep Calm and Trust God!</p>
