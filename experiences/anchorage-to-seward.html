					<p>There is something about trains that the moment someone mentions them, I get
goosebumps; my heart starts racing and invariably. It is my wish to travel through
some of the historical routes across the
world, some spanning across continents and some meandering through unbelievable
landscapes. I am always wondering about the ingenuity of the engineers who
imagined a railroad and made it a reality. I try to incorporate train journeys
to cover parts of my travel wherever feasible and affordable. The historical
route through Southern Alaska from Anchorage to the coast, ending at a small
fishing town called Seward was one such. The scenic route, with the
photogenic Alaskan Railroad trains painted in blue and yellow snaking through
lush green landscapes juxtaposed against the cool blue waters of the ocean,
aptly named &ldquo;The Coastal Classic&rdquo;, is a favourite among tourists.
The road route connecting the same places runs in tandem to the rail route for most
part and offers equally breathtaking views.</p>
<p>The journey started at a museum-like railway station at Anchorage at 5 in the
morning; the place was alive with passengers, who were, as I gathered, as excited
as me to travel on this route. I got my coffee, as we waited to board. As I
stepped outside the cozy station, I got the first sight of the beauty - the
majestic blue and yellow train, standing there in all its glory, complete with
flags along the platform that served as identification for easy boarding of
passengers. I showed my ticket and was welcomed warmly by the stewardess, who
guided me towards the general direction of seats. The seating was comfortable with
generous legroom, large windows to get unparalleled views and overhead
luggage space for the carry-on bags. By then, the daylight had started
revealing the landscape on either side of the tracks.</p>
<p>As we started moving, Kelly, the loco-pilot kept us informed about the sights
outside through her informative and engaging narration Just about ten minutes
into the journey, she asked us to keep an eye out to see the small planes parked
outside homes. Indeed! They were right there, just like cars parked in the
parking lot. The initial route was along the coast, curving along what was intriguingly named &ldquo;The
Turnagain Arm&rdquo;, so named by Thomas Cook, the explorer. The route passed
through a marsh, which I later noted, was called Potter&rsquo;s Marsh. To the left
of the track; I could spot some water birds at a distance. The homes,
dotting the landscape, as we travelled through small communities,
could be identified by the rows of boat and sea-planes parked outside.
It was their main mode of transport around here.</p>
<p>Alaska can overwhelm with its sheer raw, wild beauty,
that stretches as far as the eyes can see, with very little signs of human
habitation for miles together. Here we get to experience the rough terrain,
the untamed nature, freely roaming wildlife, everything that was so
beautiful about this continent, yet, found in its oldest, purest possible
form here in Alaska. If I had any doubts about my decision to travel to this
remote corner of the US, overshooting allocated budgets and taking my chances,
every little speck of it vanished the moment I set foot here and saw how
beautiful this land was, and how, very unique too.</p>
<p>The sun was now shining on the calm blue waters. I could spot some activity
in the water, just as I heard the engine driver exclaim &ldquo;Look to your right,
a beluga whale!&rdquo;, as we approached what is known as the Beluga Point.
I could catch a quick glimpse of its body as it dived into the water,
creating ripples. The train curved often as it travelled along the
Turnagain Arm, giving us some excellent photo shoot chances. I walked
up to one of the Vista Dome cars that had a large dome window, which provided
180 degrees panoramic view above the other coaches. A single stop was made
at a small town called Girdwood, which later I found, was home to a ski resort.</p>
<p>We were now travelling through some of the most breathtaking parts of this
journey. To the left were green mountains, covered by mist. We were climbing
from the sea level and were travelling through the Kenai Mountain Range,
one of the most beautiful and unspoilt landscapes I had seen. Lush green
plains leading up to dense forested mountains; the train slowly snaking
through these beautiful, mammoth mountain ranges, passing through some
of the mountain passes. Since it was early in the morning, a thin layer of mist
concealed the mountain tops, giving it a surreal effect. I could spot
a few waterfalls that looked like thin white slivers cutting the dense
green foliage. As I stood at the open window near the viewing platform,
I could feel the chill morning air on my cheeks. As I
learnt from Kelly&rsquo;s ongoing narration, we were passing through the green landscape,
part of the Chugach National Forest, one of the largest in the entire country.</p>
<p>Amidst the lush green mountains, I could see that we were approaching some
of the tall mountains covered by snow and glaciers. A massive sheet of bluish
ice that was clearly visible from far. It was one of the most exiting part
of the trip for most on the train, as everyone was glued to the left side
windows to get a better view of this massive glacier, called the Spencer
glacier. Seeing a glacier for the first time up close, I was mesmerized by
the surreal bluish colour with an eerie glow. The photographs of glaciers never can do
justice to their size and texture. From the base, as I viewed the glacier, it
felt as though this huge mountain was spewing icy blue lava, which would soon
flow down and engulf all of us. Kelly did not fail to mention that the glacier had shrunk
over the years; it used to be much closer to the tracks before. Some trains makes
a &ldquo;whistle stop&rdquo; at this point, such as the Glacier Discovery Route Train, for
people who would like to get off and hike or camp here.</p>
<p>I could spot a couple of more glaciers as we moved along, one of them called
the Trail Glacier, had excellent views from the train. Crossing a bridge over
a small, we reached a small community called &ldquo;Moose Pass&rdquo; situated
on the banks of Trail Lake. The town has only around two hundred people and
almost as many or more Moose! Around this time, the road that was not visible
till now could be seen again, against the backdrop of the large Kenai Lake.
A sea otter bathed and scrubbed itself as it floated in the calm turquoise waters
under the sun. We were nearing the port of Seward, which was also the terminus
for this railway line. After crossing the Resurrection River, the train entered
into Seward at a historical depot called Mile 0 (although the train does not
really enter this and stops a little distance away on the tracks).
My journey, as well as the train&rsquo;s trip ended here. The train would stay here
till evening and return along the same route to Anchorage.</p>
