      <description>For most people, Thailand is Bangkok and vis-a-vis. That included us too, until we had the opportunity to travel to Chiang Mai which happens to be an equally (if not more) important city in Thailand and has much to offer. We hardly had enough time to explore enough but these photographs are from one of the days we felt adventurous enough to venture into the busy city streets.</description>

      <description>The various shades of blue on either side of the main road told us that we had reached our destination - Ban Thung Hong, the Blue Village as it is popularly known. A group of six friends with a shared passion for indigo, we had set out to explore the source of this beautiful colour. True to its name, this quaint village, just outside the city of Phrae is a relic from the Kingdom of Old Siam.</description>
