      <title>From the Bolivian Highlands of La Paz, to Copacabana</title>

      <description>There are many ways to travel from La Paz, Bolivia to Cusco, Peru. What we chose to do was use the services of Bolivia Hop which is a hop-on-hop-off bus service that also had an optional stopover at Copacabana. These pictures tell the story of the first leg of that journey.</description>

      <title>High Altitude Capital City, La Paz, Bolivia</title>

      <description>La Paz, the highest capital city in the world. What does it feel like? We knew very little, because we mostly used La Paz as a hop-off point for our trip to other seductive corners of Bolivia, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a wonder that we could relegate to the back-burner for long. So off we went on a short walk around the city to find out.</description>

      <title>Getting Stuck at Tumbes</title>

      <description>If getting to Tumbes wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy, getting out wasn&amp;rsquo;t any easier either. As I sat staring at the news-reporter on the TV and reading the news-ticker which was in English reporting on the riots in Ecuador, I felt completely helpless and hopeless. All the local TV channels were reporting on the same topic and no amount of switching channels was going to change anything for us. We were simply destined to be stuck in that mostly unknown border town till something changed radically in the next few days or we retreated in defeat.</description>

      <title>The Amazon and its Tributaries</title>

      <description>It was exactly how I had imagined it; perhaps better than that, because I remember sitting on that boat spellbound and self-aware that I had gone very quiet. The boat was navigating through the Maranon river in whose waters reflected the rising sun. The reflection moved ahead as we did ever so slowly, unhurried by the seeming speed that was implied by the engine itself which was the only thing I can remember as noise.</description>

      <title>Homes on Stilts in the Amazon</title>

      <description>The bare-bones dwelling on stilts appeared like creatures that could discreetly shy away inland when the river asserts its rights annually. I was excited like never before to step inside, as Jana (pronounced Yaana) explained the basics to us. Jana was a volunteer with the organization. She spoke with passion about the project; its mission and accomplishments. But mainly, she paused to speak about the mosquitoes when I inquired. I did not have an original inquiry.</description>

      <title>The Amazonian Community of San Jose de Uchupiamonas</title>

      <description>Very soon, the driver of our car sounded excited and stopped the car by the side of the road. Soon, we were all looking in the direction where he was looking. He had spotted some furry animals; extremely cute rodents. 5 or 6 young ones of the Capybara. The mother was nearby, quite large in comparison. Soon she and her flock disappeared into a burrow. This was our first sighting of Capybaras and we were extremely happy to see them from so near, just by the side of the road.</description>

      <title>Howler Monkeys and the Ultimate Insult</title>

      <description>We had walked for almost four hours now. With the dense canopy, it was hard to gauge the exact time of the day. I was starting to become a bit weary trying to keep one foot in front of the other, very gently and as noiselessly as possible. The mosquitoes took advantage of my tiredness and launched a fresh assault. My ears had to stay alert to grasp any sign of monkeys or birds around.</description>

      <title>The Incan Holy Grail</title>

      <description>The early morning mist enhanced the view. I was surrounded by huge lush green mountains as our bus ascended, revealing various nooks and corners. The massive green mounds appeared to float in the mist, green rocks in a vast sea of white. The air was chilly outside our bus, getting colder with every bend of the ascent. I felt the excitement of having entered something sacred, something unspoilt and hidden. To reach this sacred site by walk might have been something more spiritual.</description>

      <title>Parque Arvi : Nature overlooking Medellin</title>

      <description>Lucky are the people of Medellin that just an hour away from the busy city is one of the most beautiful parks that has not just breathtaking scenery but also some amazing biodiversity. When we ended up a whole day late in Medellin, at night, after our harrowing flight without our bags, little did I know that the misfortunes we faced the previous day would be compensated manifold by allowing us an extra day in the city that was not earlier planned.</description>

      <title>Day trip to Playa Blanca, Colombia</title>

      <description>The thought of white sandy beaches with blue waters felt almost too good to be true. Tourists mostly head to Cartagena to experience exactly this. The Caribbean islands are famous for some of the most pristine and picturesque beaches in the world. We were surprisingly one of the few who were in Cartagena without a clear intention of soaking in the sun on one of these beaches. Reluctantly, one morning, we walked to one of the hostels which was arranging day tours to Playa Blanca, which, in Spanish, simply means the White Beach.</description>

      <title>By the Caribbean coast of Cartagena</title>

      <description>If you would find yourself stuck in a time loop, where you find yourself waking up in the same place each day for the rest of your life, where would you like it to be? When I ask myself this question, one of the places that came to my mind was Cartagena. This coastal city of Northern Colombia is one of those places that offers many experiences at the same time.</description>

      <title>Tallest Palm in the World</title>
      <link>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/tallest-palm-in-the-world.html</link>

      <guid>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/tallest-palm-in-the-world.html</guid>
      <description>I looked up a slender tree right in front of me, I lifted my head up and up, bent backwards as far as I could balance, but failed to see the crown. The morning sun was filtering through the scant crown of the giant palms blinding me as I squinted to gauge the full extent of its height. What seemed like a regular palm tree from a distance, unimpressive at a first glance, grew to unbelievable height as I approached it.</description>

      <title>No one can stop looking at Jardin</title>

      <description>I have many a times sifted through my memories to focus on the colourful postcards in my mind&amp;rsquo;s eye that for me represent Jardin, and I have wondered, what was it that I did there for a couple of days? As simple as it might sound, nothing really. Absolutely nothing if I were to be accurate. Yes. If there is a really good venue for doing nothing, then it had to be Jardin.</description>

      <title>Trip to a Bolivian Consulate</title>
      <link>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/trip-to-a-bolivian-consulate.html</link>

      <description>Most of the tourists who land at the Calama Airport in Northern Chile have but one purpose which is to book a direct taxi to their real destination, San Pedro de Atacama, the jewel of the Atacama desert, a picturesque town that is tailored around tourism. Calama, on the other hand is a mining town visited by workers - both short and long term - and people who have some business connected to mining.</description>

      <title>Lounge-birding at Sadiri lodge</title>

      <guid>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/lounge-birding-at-sadiri-lodge.html</guid>
      <description>We got a glimpse of what we would experience after 3 days when we stepped into Sadiri Lodge briefly to put away some our clothes that we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be needing during the camping. The lodge was located on a hill, the steep slope of which was lined with a stone-pitched stairway that we arduously climbed. The entrance of the prominent looking building, completely built of wood, led to the dining hall with a large balcony overlooking the dramatic mountain ranges of Amazon rainforests.</description>

      <title>Birdwatching in the Bolivian Amazon</title>
      <link>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/amazing-birds-of-amazon.html</link>

      <guid>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/amazing-birds-of-amazon.html</guid>
      <description>If I had one favourite species, which bird would I really like to see? That was the question posed to me by Ricardo, our guide. My ambitious yet truthful answer to his question was, the Harpy&amp;rsquo;s Eagle. Ricardo smiled and I returned it. But we weren&amp;rsquo;t kidding each other. The bird watching experience here in the Amazon was supposed to be bit different, and by different, I mean very challenging when compared to what I had experienced up until then, back home.</description>

      <title>We still have not seen the Tapir</title>

      <description>At 4am, I could see the faint light in the other tents. Braving the cold and in complete darkness with the help of a flash-light, I managed to crawl out of mine. The moonless sky shone with a million stars. Wearing our rubber boots our team of four started walking towards the forest. The cicadas seemed to cheer us on and follow us into the darkness as we moved in. The eerie ambience was complemented by a million other insects that were probably protesting as we walked through the maze of branches and roots.</description>
