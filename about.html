				<h2 id="the-name">The Name</h2>
<p>What&rsquo;s in a name?</p>
<p><strong>Yātrāmaya</strong> is
made up of two words. <strong>Yātra</strong> and <strong>Māya</strong>. It is a coerced
confluence of two rivers of thought, one where the material
meets the mental and physical meets the philosophical.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in a name? Apparently, the universe itself!</p>
<p>A tiny blue coloured speck of dust that seems to forever
travel around and away from its star is what we call our home.
Planet Earth, our mothership traces a new line around the
Sun every second since its existence thus taking us along
on this incredible journey that never started and never ends.
To limit the content of this website with the English term
<strong>travel</strong>, thus seemed reductive to us. If we peek under the
exoticised layer, the eastern word <strong>Yātra</strong> means travel,
pilgrimage, procession, journey and all of that put together. And
yet, under the simplest of contexts it also provides the
groundedness that we desired in the physical limitations
that we encounter on our blue planet.</p>
<p><strong>Māya</strong> on the other hand was everything turned inside
out. Whether it is the inside-out hypersphere of four dimensional
worlds or quite simply the human mind that can imagine its
own universes, the word <strong>Māya</strong> seemed appropriate for
a situation where we simply cannot mimic and share what
we all feel and experience in our lives. Travel and travelogues
are words we use carefully and hesitantly because these
aren&rsquo;t separate from <em>what</em>, <em>when</em> and <em>how</em> we experience them
and most of all, <em>who</em>. Our dreams, thoughts and experiences
aren&rsquo;t yours and yet we seem to dream up the same locations,
breathe the same air and drink the same water every once
in a while. Sharing the center stage sometimes in the play
that is enacted inside Vishnu&rsquo;s dream.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in a name? Apparently, practicality itself!</p>
<p><strong>Yātrāmaya</strong> was thus born and the union of words now simply means
&ldquo;made up of journeys&rdquo;. Here somehow in its simplistic communicable form
we share these figments of physical-truth and mental-cloud with you.
We call these short, long and sometimes extremely-long journeys as
<strong>Experiences</strong>, if only to call them something.</p>
<h2 id="engagement-in-disengagement">Engagement in disengagement</h2>
<p>Quite often and by many, travel is understood as a form of disengagement
from what is the material and economic. This isn&rsquo;t very different from
the assumption that someone on a spiritual quest seems detached from
the social realities of life; aloof and distracted. Both of these
ideas are constructions of culture and tradition that values private
property albeit in two distinct forms. In the former - the western form -
the individual who does not seem to be productive economically seems like
a traveller and in the latter it is the individual who does not seem
to contribute towards his worldly duties. In both cases, private property
suffers, the word property used in a sense to mean what one &ldquo;protects&rdquo;
and is &ldquo;grounded in reality&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The physical act of moving from one place to another is at the very core
of the substance that we are made of. The stardust that we are made of
is on an eternal quest to merge and separate from each other and it is
not something we have human control on. But even if we keep that elemental
urge aside, the emotional need to connect with the larger being is so
strong that travel is the only way of actually merging into what we
separate from ourselves so much, the nature that surrounds us. In fact,
that is the root of the problem. Our vocabulary. The moment we construct
that it is nature that surrounds us or is separate from us, there is
a need to disengage from a role and engage in the role of traveling. But
for a traveler who &ldquo;is&rdquo; nature this is a seamless shift and borderless
concepts.</p>
<p><strong>Yātrāmaya</strong> is about sharing these moments of realization. To call it
a commune with nature would only go to explain the physical experience
and further perpetuates the idea of duality. To call it a &ldquo;moment of
clarity&rdquo; would perhaps sound subjective but would be closer. Whatever
we call it, it is too large and sacred an experience but worth sharing.
That is why we have tried to keep these moments short, diverse and
across our home planet. We sure hope that it takes you on your own <strong>Yātra</strong>
which bring you joy and satisfaction.</p>
<h2 id="dreamwalkers">Dreamwalkers</h2>
<p>To navigate a dream isn&rsquo;t easy. Gravity aside, there aren&rsquo;t reliable
signposts to take us anywhere. But to think like that is to assume that
we have understood the physical world completely. How reliable are memories?
Was that movie you experienced in low resolution any different from
the re-release you saw in high definition? Is watching the moon with
the naked eye with your loved one any different from seeing it with
the binoculars? Or is that story that your father told you all your
life now just a story that you tell others? This world being a gaseous
and electric construction of our minds makes it all the more equal to
what we call dreams that we experience in our sleep.</p>
<p>If that is the case, then what is travel? What is a personal experience
and what is the big deal about sharing it? Is there an active person
at one end and a passive person at the receiving end?</p>
<p>We try to explore these questions more often than not, especially while
we aren&rsquo;t lost in the material comforts that are offered by traveling.
But more often than not the travel experiences you will find here are
more about the internal journeys that we went through during the
physical process. It is about accepting the sanctity of the larger
self and it is about respect for a larger being than ourselves. It is
a sacred experience and chipping off of yet another layer of ego.</p>
<h2 id="navigating-around-here">Navigating around here</h2>
<p>You will probably find this place intuitive enough to look around. We
have used the familiar medium of language, words and images to try
and recollect and bring you sections of this long journey. It is possible
that we shared some of these with you in the physical self somewhere
when we collided in this universe. Or it is possible we nurtured and
shared the same dream. It is possible that your dream happened to be
the physical space in which we experienced it. What is important for
us is for you to enjoy and feel satiated by these experiences. Do
write to us if you share the same space. You will find our contact
details somewhere around here.</p>
