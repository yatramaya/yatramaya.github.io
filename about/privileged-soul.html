				<p>I sit down to work; My thoughts roam astray. I don’t seem to recollect what I set out to do. The work piles up; it is way past the deadlines. I keep making excuses; I keep extending the timeline. A proper estimate is impossible to give because I don’t know for sure how long this will go on. I am disturbed. I push myself to sit down and write a few lines at least. Just like I force myself to cook and eat. Just a few spoons. Quickly. Sleep eludes me. Whatever little I can manage is engulfed by nightmares. There are times when my mind bursts with ideas; I feel like everything will be alright. Isn’t there daylight always after a dark night? But the days are as gloomy as the nights. And the dark clouds just refuse to go away.</p>
<p>Life as I know it has ceased to exist. And this has become the new normal. Not just for me. But for a lot of my friends, people who are in a similar situation and can connect with what I am saying. If you have been there too, you will know. Going about “business as usual” is not an option anymore. Unknowing the truth, undermining it, is not an option anymore. Ignoring the injustice around and going about our daily chores is not an option anymore. Our world is disrupted. We cannot escape it anymore. It is that close.</p>
<p>There are times when I wish that I could rewind my life to ten years ago. When things were brighter, when the world was a better place. But as much as that is impossible, I start to realise an even bitter truth. That the world was always unjust. But it was me who is more aware of it now. It is me who is choosing not to turn my back on it now. I do not want to plunge into the negativity. I need to keep it going. I need to pick up myself every day and fight. In whatever way I can. With whatever strength I have. I feel the guilt strongly. I feel the helplessness. The sorrow pains my heart. I feel like shutting off. But not for long. I am again drawn into reality. I cannot keep myself away from the truth for long.</p>
<p>My personal life has paused. I feel guilty experiencing small joys, feeling pleasure. I feel guilty going out and having some fun. At home, our conversations have become serious. We are aware of the impending dangers of where we are headed. We desperately try to forget it, to indulge in small talk, to have some fun. But sooner or later, the gloom creeps in, the terror strikes our minds and we start feeling desperate to do something.</p>
<p>My friendships have never been clearer. I can see that there is a divide, a deep chasm that has developed in my friends circle. Whom I considered friends have moved away; they are now mere acquaintances, if at all still on talking terms. And I have some new found friends, for whom I am thankful. We huddle together; we dream together; we fear together.</p>
<p>I realise that being privileged comes with a great responsibility. Of standing up for those who cannot speak. To take up the cause of those who do not have a voice or whose voices are suppressed. To fight against the injustice; the exploitation of the weaker. I realise that the knowledge I have gained is not to be ignored and wasted. It is to be put to right use.</p>
<p>When I look around, I see a lot of ignorant people going about their lives, trying to make ends meet. And I see a lot of privileged people ignoring the injustice, shutting themselves from the hardships and leading their cushioned lives. I am fortunate enough to not be in the first group and responsible enough to choose to not be in the second. The weaker will fight for themselves, eventually, when it comes to survival. But it is for us to see this beforehand and prevent the large-scale suffering. If you know the truth, do not pretend to be blind. There is no greater sin than that.</p>
<p>It is important to not lose focus, to be persistent. At the same time, it is important to rest, review and come back with renewed energy. We cannot let ourselves slip into depression. We need to sustain our strength for the long haul. We need to protest and resist. But also think of constructive ways to build our society. If it is a new world that we dream of, it is not just enough to win the battles, but also to build that world. And that takes a lot of work. Most importantly to let our minds stay sane, healthy and sharp.</p>
<p>We need to support each other, motivate ourselves and inspire one another positively. And we need to do whatever possible, because, remember, today we are able to say we have a choice whether to act or not. There are already a lot of them who are left with no choice at all. It is for them that we fight.</p>
